AT ODDS WITH THE COMPASS.</h2></div>


<p>East or west, north or south? With
all the experience of a man's years
and the knowledge of many wise books
of travel, I could not tell. I had taken
no note of the sun when I left, and, neglected
then, it would not serve me now
as a guide. To me at that moment all
points of the compass were the same.</p>

<p>The provoking sun which I could not
use as a sign-post seemed bent upon
showing how brilliant it really could be.
The last shred of white and harmless
cloud had been driven from the heavens,
which were a deep unbroken blue, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the golden lining showing through like a
faint, yellow haze. The glowing light
clothed the earth, and intensified the red
and yellow and brown tints of the leaves,
painted by the master artist, autumn. In
such a glorious flush the woods and the
mountains were a dazzle and tangle of
color. But through all the glow and
blaze of the sun came the crisp and
tonic coolness which marks the waning
autumn and makes it best and most
beautiful as it goes. It was good to be
alone with forest and mountain. To
breathe and to see were enough.</p>

<p>I cared nothing at the moment for
the lost camp and my comrades of the
hunt. Yet I was in no Arcady. Take
down the map of Kentucky, and you
will see in the east a vast region, roughened
over with the dark scrawls meaning
mountains, through which no railroad
comes, and few roads of any kind either.
Add to it other large and similar portions
of the map contiguous in Virginia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
West Virginia, and Tennessee, and you
have enough country to make a brave
kingdom,&mdash;a kingdom, too, over which
no man yet has been able to make himself
ruler, not even any governor of the
four States, and they have had some fine
and fit governors. In this kingdom of
mountain and wilderness I was lost, and
was not mourning it, for the time.</p>

<p>A light wind stirred the currents of
air and began that faint, curious moaning
through the drying leaves which I call
the swan-song of autumn. The brilliant
foliage quivered before the light
touch of the breeze, and the reds and
the yellows and the browns and the lingering
bits of green shifted and changed
like shaken pieces of colored silk.</p>

<p>But one must do more than merely
breathe and see, or even listen to the
wind playing on the autumn leaves.
This kingdom might be mine by right
of sole tenancy, but after a little I preferred&mdash;greatly
preferred&mdash;to find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
partner of my throne who would feed
me and house me and show me my way
back to camp. Not knowing any other
mode by which to choose, I chose the
direction which indicated the easiest
foot-path, though that might lead me
farthest astray. I put my rifle upon my
shoulder and walked through the yellowing
grass and the short red bushes,
over hills and down gullies, which were
a trial to muscles and the forgiving spirit.
But I came to nothing which looked
familiar, not a tree, not a bush, not a
hill, not a rock.</p>

<p>I began to tire of the monotony of
the wilderness, which was lately so beautiful;
ever the same reds and yellows
and browns and bits of lingering green;
ever the same burnt grass and purpling
bushes and rocky hills; but never a
human being except myself, and I am
not company for two. When one
grows lonesome beauty departs. I
abused the wilderness in its unchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
garb, and longed for the camp and the
ugly black cook frying strips of bacon
over the coals. Hunger will not be denied
its complaints, though in my case
they availed nothing.</p>

<p>I wandered about until the spirit and
the flesh rebelled sorely and called upon
me for the relief which I had not to give.
Both ankles were in a state of open
mutiny; and I sat down upon the crest
of a high hill to soothe them into temporary
quiet. I observed then a very
marked change in the skies, real, and not
due to the state of my mind. The sun,
as if satisfied with a half-day's splendor,
was withdrawing. Some clouds, dark
purple streaks showing in them, hid the
blue and made the skies sombre. All
the bright color with which the wilderness
had prinked and primped itself in
the sunshine faded and became dull in
this twilight afternoon.</p>

<p>It needed no weather-wise prophet to
guess quickly the meaning of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
changes. In the mountains a whiff of
snow sometimes comes very early,&mdash;now
and then so early that it whitens
the skirt of lingering autumn. The
clouds and the misty air with the chilly
damp in it betokened such an arrival.
Once more I longed for our snug little
valley, with the camp, half tent, half
cabin, and the sight of the fat black
cook frying strips of bacon over the
glowing coals.</p>

<p>I had no fear of a heavy snow. The
season was too early, I thought, for anything
more than a mere spatter of white.
But snow, whether in large or small
quantities, is wet and cold, and it was
sufficient to be lost, without these new
troubles.</p>

<p>From the hill I thought I could see a
valley far to the northeast, with the blue
and silver waters of a brook or small
river shining here and there through the
foliage. I decided to make all haste toward
it, for in these mountains human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
life seeks the valleys, and if I found
food and shelter at all it would most
likely be there.</p>

<p>I took small account of the rough
way, and almost ran over the stones and
through the scrub. I was in some
alarm, for which there was ample cause.
The clouds thickened, and clothed the
higher peaks. Yet I was cheered by
my belief that in truth I had seen a valley
of some extent; the patches of blue
and silver water showed more plainly
through the distant foliage, which looked
greener than the withering leaves on the
mountain, indicating a sheltered and
warmer zone. Rising hope brought
back some of my strength, and when I
reached the summit of a new hill in the
long rows of hills that thrust themselves
before me as if to bar my way, I was
ready to shout for gladness at the sight
of smoke.</p>

<p>The smoke rose from the valley,
merely a faint spiral of blue, slowly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>cending,
and melting so imperceptibly
into the clouds that I could not tell
where it ended. Yet there was never a
more welcome sight to me than that
little smoky wisp which told so plainly
of man's presence.</p>

<p>I pushed on with new zeal, stumbled
against a stone, and rose with an ankle
that made bitter complaints. It was not
a sprain, but it was unpleasantly near
one, and I doubted my ability to walk
with the cripple over so wicked a way
to the valley. I abused the cruelty of
fate, which was but my own carelessness
and haste, and then tried to think out
the matter. My first impulse was to
throw aside my gun and escape its
weight; that led to my second, which
was to fire it in the hope of attracting
attention.</p>

<p>I had plenty of cartridges. I discharged
a bullet into the air. The echo
was carried from hill-top to hill-top,
until at last I heard it faintly speeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
away through the distant mountains.
If any one were near, such a report
could not escape his ears; but the only
answer was the snow, which began to
fall as if my shot had been the signal
for its coming. The soft flakes descended
gently, but they would soon
put a sheet of white over all the ridges.
Some melted on my face, and the damp
chilled me. It was not a time to spare
my crippled ankle. I limped on, firing
my rifle a second, third, and fourth time.
I could still see the spiral of smoke, a
true beacon to me, though it was all but
hid by the increasing clouds.</p>

<p>I fired the fifth time, and while the
echo was yet travelling among the peaks
I heard a faint and very distant halloo.
I had no doubt that it was an answer to
my shot, and, to be sure, I emptied a
sixth cartridge into the air. Back came
the far cry. Like the shot, it too was
taken up by the echo: ridge repeated it
to ridge, faint and far away, until I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
not tell from what point of the compass
the true sound had come.</p>

<p>I was perplexed, but hopeful. I believed
that help of some kind was near.
I sat down on a rock and expended
much ammunition. The snow was still
coming down in the same gentle undecided
way, but I was compelled to stop
between shots and brush the damp,
white patches off my clothing.</p>

<p>Presently the answering halloo sounded
very near me, and I ceased to fire, replying
with a shout.</p>

<p>Two large dogs scampered through
the bushes, and, approaching me, began
to bark as if they had brought game to
bay. A strong voice ordered them to
be quiet, and then the owner of dogs
and voice came into view.</p>

<p>I had expected the usual mountaineer,
sallow, angular, and shabby, but I saw
at once that this man was different. The
clean-featured, keen, intelligent face could
not belong to one of the ignorant dwellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in cabins. He was tall, thin, and past
sixty, well dressed in a gray uniform,
upon which the brass buttons shone with
peculiar brightness. I had seen such uniforms
before, but they were relics, and
men do not often wear them nowadays.</p>

<p>He approached me, walking in the
upright fashion of a military man, and
showed much strength and activity for
one so far advanced in years.</p>

<p>"I must apologize for my dogs, sir,"
he said. "They see strangers but seldom,
and when they do see one they
must lift up their voices and announce it
to all the world."</p>

<p>"The sight of your dogs, and still
more that of their master, is very welcome
to me," I replied.</p>

<p>He bowed with ancient grace and
thanked me for my courtesy.</p>

<p>"I must ask your help," I said. "I've
lost my way, and I've bruised my ankle
so badly on a stone that I fear I cannot
walk many more miles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not far to my place," he replied,
"and I will be glad to offer you
such hospitality as it can afford."</p>

<p>I looked at him with the greatest curiosity,
a curiosity, too, that increased with
all he said. He had no weapon, nothing
to indicate that he was a hunter; and the
uniform of a fashion that went out of
style forever, I thought, more than thirty
years ago, with its gleaming brass buttons
and freshness of texture, drew more
than one inquiring glance from me,
despite my effort not to appear curious
to a stranger upon whom I had
become dependent. But if he noticed
my curiosity it did not appear in his
manner.</p>

<p>The dogs, secure in the judgment of
their master, sniffed about me in friendly
fashion. The man pointed toward the
corkscrew of smoke which the clouds
and the film of snow had not yet hidden.</p>

<p>"My home is there," he said. "Come,
let us start. This is no place for a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in your condition to linger. If your
ankle gives way I can help you."</p>

<p>But rest had improved my ankle, and
I found that I could walk in a tolerable
manner. He took my gun from me,
put it over his own shoulder, and whistled
to the dogs. They were leaping
about like two panthers in play, but at
his whistle they ceased the sport and
marched sedately, neck and neck, toward
the rising smoke, leading the way for
us.</p>

<p>The old man chose the way as if he
knew it, avoiding the rougher slopes and
winding about in a sort of path which
made the walking much easier for me.
As if good luck brought good luck, the
snow ceased, and the sun, returning,
drove all the clouds out of the heavens.
The lustrous sunshine again gilded all
the colors of mountains and forest and
brought out the fine and delicate tints of
the reds and yellows and browns. The
white skim of snow over the earth dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>solved
in tears, and the warm sun that
made them drank them up.</p>

<p>The valley lying fresh and yet green
below us broadened. The coil of
smoke grew into a column.</p>

<p>"Did you say your camp lay there?"
I asked, pointing toward the valley.
We had been silent hitherto.</p>

<p>"I did not say my camp, sir; I said
my home," he replied, with some
haughtiness. "Twenty yards farther,
and you can see through the trees a corner
of the roof of Fort Defiance."</p>

<p>I did not understand him. I saw no
reason for his high tone, and much was
strange in what he said. Yet he had
the manner and bearing of a gentleman,
and he had been a timely friend to me.
I had no right to ask him curious questions.</p>

<p>He did not seem inclined to further
talk, and I too was silent. But I found
employment for my eyes. We were
descending the first slopes of the valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and it lay before us a welcome oasis in
the weary wilderness of mountains.</p>

<p>It must have been several miles in
length and a good mile or more across.
Down the centre of it flowed a creek of
clear, cool water, almost big enough to
call itself a river, and the thickness of the
tree-trunks and the long grass browned
by the autumn breath showed the fertility
of the soil. Through the trees, which
still retained much of their foliage, the
corners of house-roofs appeared. There
are many such secluded and warm little
valleys in the Alleghanies, and I saw no
occasion for surprise. In truth, what I
saw was most welcome: it indicated the
comfort of which I stood in need.</p>

<p>"I haven't asked you your name,"
said my host, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Arthur West," I replied.</p>

<p>"I would infer from your accent that
you are a Northerner, a Yankee," he
said, looking at me closely, and in a
way I did not quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right on the first point, but
not on the second," I replied. "I am a
Northerner, but not a Yankee. I am
not from New England, but from New
York City."</p>

<p>"It's all the same," he replied, frowning.
"You're a Yankee, and I knew it
from the first. We call the people of
all the Northern States Yankees."</p>

<p>"Have it so," I replied, with a laugh.
"But abroad they call us all Yankees,
whether from the Northern or the Southern
States."</p>

<p>"Luckily I never go abroad," he replied,
frowning still more deeply. "You
have not asked me my own name," he
continued.</p>

<p>"No, but I confess I would like to
hear it," I replied. "I wish to know
whose hospitality I am about to enjoy, a
hospitality for which I can never thank
you too much, for if I had not met
you I might have starved or frozen to
death in this wilderness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am Colonel John Greene Hetherill,
C.S.A.," he replied.</p>

<p>"C.S.A.?" I said, looking at his gray
uniform.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'C.S.A.,'" he replied. His
tone was emphatic and haughty. "Confederate
States of America. What
have you to say against it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied. "I leave that
to the historians."</p>

<p>"Who are mostly liars," he said.</p>

<p>He looked at me with an expression
of undoubted hostility.</p>

<p>"I would have liked it much better
had you been a Southerner and not
a Yankee," he said. "How can I trust
you?"</p>

<p>"I hope I am a gentleman," I replied.
"At any rate, I am lame and in straits,
and under no circumstances would I
violate your hospitality."</p>

<p>His expression softened. He even
looked at me with pity.</p>

<p>"Well, it's the word of a Yankee,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he said, "but still&mdash;it may be the truth.
Remember that on your word of honor
you are to tell nothing about Fort Defiance,
its approaches or its plans."</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said, though secretly
wondering.</p>

<p>He seemed to be relieved of his
doubts, and, descending the last slope,
we walked at a brisk pace down the
valley.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the evidences of
care and cultivation, though the fat,
black soil of the valley would justify
all the labor that might be put upon it.
The fences were good, the fields well
trimmed, and we soon entered a smooth
road. Everything seemed to have the
neatness and precision of the proprietor,
the man with whom I was walking. I
looked at him again, and was struck
with the evidences of long military
habit; not alone his uniform, but even
more decidedly his manner and bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>We passed some outhouses built in a
better manner than I had seen elsewhere
in the mountain valleys, and approached
a large square building which I knew at
first sight to be Fort Defiance, since it
could be nothing else. It was of two
stories, made of heavy logs, unhewn on
the outside, the upper story projecting
over the lower, after the fashion of the
block-houses of the frontier time. I
supposed it to be some such building,
standing here after the lapse of a hundred
years in all its ancient solidity and
devoted now to more peaceful uses.</p>

<p>The valley was no less pleasant to eye
than to mind. When one is sore and
hungry, mountains lose their picturesqueness
and grandeur; a crust and a bed
are infinitely more beautiful, and this
valley promised both and better. The
house stood upon a hill which rose to
some height and was shaped like a truncated
cone. The little river flowed
around three sides of the hill in a swift,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
deep current. The fourth side I could
not see, but the three washed at the base
by the river were so steep a man could
climb them only with great difficulty.
It was a position of much natural
strength, and in the old times, when rifles
were the heaviest weapons used in these
regions, it must have been impregnable
except to surprise.</p>

<p>The road we were following curved
around and approached the house from
the south side, the side which at first
had been hidden from me, and then I
saw it was the only ordinary way by
which one could enter Fort Defiance.
But even here art had been brought to
the aid of nature. A wide, deep ditch
leading from the river had been carried
around the south side, and the mound
was completely encircled by water. We
crossed the ditch on a drawbridge let
down by an old man in Confederate
gray like his master, though his was
stained and more ancient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the architecture of the fort been
different, had it been stone instead of
logs, I could easily have imagined myself
back in some mediæval castle of
Europe, and not here in the mountains
of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The fort looked very peaceful. Smoke
rose from three or four chimneys, and,
drifting, finally united, floating off into
the clouds. This was the lazy coil which
I had seen, and which perhaps had saved
my life.</p>

<p>We climbed some stone steps, and
when I reached the top I found a little
old-fashioned brass field-piece confronting
me. But there was no rust on its muzzle,
which looked at me with the semblance
of a threat.</p>

<p>"One would think from your preparations,
colonel, that we were in a state of
war," I said, jestingly.</p>

<p>"Have you any weapons on you?"
he asked, frowning again, and not answering
my jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," I replied; "I had nothing but
the rifle, and you have that."</p>

<p>"I will keep it for the present," he
said, curtly.</p>

<p>We paused before a heavy door of
oak. While the colonel knocked, I
looked up at the overhanging edges of
the second floor and saw that they were
pierced for sharpshooters. But before I
had time to look long, the door was
opened by a man in a suit of Confederate
gray, like his fellow at the drawbridge.
He saluted the colonel in military
fashion as the others had done, and
we entered a wide hall which seemed
to run the entire width of the house.
Many of the old houses in Kentucky
are built in this fashion. The hall was
decorated, I might almost say armed,
with weapons,&mdash;rifles, pistols, bayonets,
swords, many of them of the most modern
type. Tanned skins of bear, deer,
and wolf were on the floor. Had it not
been for the late style of the weapons, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
could have maintained the fiction that it
was a castle of the Middle Ages and this
the baronial hall.</p>

<p>He led me up a flight of steps, and
opened the door of a small room on the
second floor. The room contained nothing
but a small table, a camp-bed, a
three-legged stool, and two or three other
articles of furniture equally plain. There
was but a single window, and it was
cross-barred heavily with iron. It looked
more like a cell than a chamber. Nor
did it belie its looks.</p>

<p>"This will be your prison for the
present," said the colonel. "Lie down
on the bed there and rest, and Crothers
will be up in ten minutes with food for
you."</p>

<p>"Prison!" I exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, prison," he repeated, "but that
is all. I do not intend to deal harshly
with you otherwise. You are a Yankee,
and I must see that you do not meddle."</p>

<p>He cut short my protest by leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the room, slamming the door, and locking
it. The door was so thick I could
not hear his retreating footsteps. As the
colonel had said, I was a prisoner, but I
did not feel much alarm. I had confidence
in his promise that I would come
to no harm. I looked between the bars
of the window, which opened upon a
small space like a court. One side of
the court was open and ran sheer up to
the edge of the cliff, which dropped
away thirty or forty feet to the river
below. The torrent foamed around the
mound with a tumult like a mill-race.
Beyond were open fields, ending abruptly
at the foot of steep and rough mountains.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h2 id="II">CHAPTER II.<br />ON TRIAL.</h2></div>


<p>My eyes followed the long sweep of
the mountains, their shaggy outline
cutting the clear blue of the skies;
then they came back to the court, and
for the moment I thought that they had
deceived me, for either I saw the flutter
of a woman's dress or imagination was
my master. A woman in this rough
fortress was the last thing for me to expect.
But I reflected that it was not so
strange, after all. A serving-woman,
probably, the wife of one of the colonel's
retainers. It was in keeping with the
character of the place, which in my
fancy I had turned into a baronial keep.</p>

<p>I saw the flutter of the dress again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and then its wearer came into better
view. She was looking at the river, and
stood with her back toward the house.
That was no common serving-woman,
the wife of no laborer. The figure was
too slender, too erect; there was too
much distinction and grace in the pose,
and the dress itself was of good cut and
material. That was all that I could see,
save a mass of coiled, dark brown hair.</p>

<p>I was full of curiosity, nor do I think
I was prying because of it. Put yourself
in my place and see. In a few moments
she turned and looked directly up
at my window, though she could not
have known that I was gazing out at
her. It was the face of a girl of twenty,
fair and strong, yet sad. Even at the
distance between us, I could see enough
resemblance to guess that she was Colonel
Hetherill's daughter. A likely
enough supposition, anyway, for what
girl of such appearance could be here
unless his daughter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up at my window only a
moment or two, and then, walking with
a light and graceful step, disappeared
through some door opening into the
court. I hold that I am not without a
fair share of imagination; and easily I
builded a fine romance for myself. Here
was I, an innocent prisoner in the cruel
baron's castle, and this was his fair daughter,
who would fall in love with me and
rescue me. By Jove! she was handsome
enough for me to fall in love with
her. The only trouble about my romance
was that in the morning after a
good night's rest I would be sent with a
guide to our hunting-camp, and that
would be the end of it.</p>

<p>Happily, when I reached this conclusion,
the door was opened, and Crothers
came in with food, for which I was devoutly
grateful. Crothers&mdash;I had heard
the colonel call him so&mdash;was the man
who had opened the door for us, a
hatchet-faced, battered old fellow, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
walked with a limp and who yet looked
strong and active.</p>

<p>Evidently the colonel had no mind to
starve me, for Crothers bore enough for
two upon his tray. A smoking pot of
coffee, steaks of venison and beef, warm
biscuits, and butter, made a sight as welcome
to my eyes as a Raphael to an artist's,
and created odors that were divine.
My spirits rose to the summer-heat
mark.</p>

<p>"I see that the colonel has a proper
regard for my health and well-being,
Crothers," I said, jovially.</p>

<p>"The colonel hates all Yankees, and
so do the rest of us," he said, in surly
fashion; "but he doesn't want to starve
any of you to death, though I guess you
starved enough of us to death in Camp
Chase."</p>

<p>"Camp Chase? what the deuce was
that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"One of your war prisons," he replied.
"Try that coffee; you'll find it good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and you'll find the venison and the beef
to be good too."</p>

<p>I had no doubt that I would. I put
the question immediately to proof, which,
I may add, was satisfactory. Encouraged
by his friendly comment upon the food,
in which he seemed to take a certain
pride, perhaps having cooked it himself,
I spoke to him in friendly fashion, expecting
a reply of like tenor. But he
seemed to have repented of his sudden
courtesy, and made no reply. He had
placed the tray upon the table, and without
further word or action left the room.
I heard him locking my door with as
much care as if he had been Colonel
Hetherill himself.</p>

<p>I began now to feel that I was in truth
and reality a prisoner, a fact which I
contemplated before only in a humorous
or make-believe way. Nevertheless it
did not interfere with my appetite. I
realized that prisoners may become as
hungry as free men, and, as I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
truthfully say I knew not where the
next meal would come from, I made
satisfactory disposition of this.</p>

<p>Refreshed and strengthened, I put the
emptied tray on the floor, and drew my
stool to the window, where I took a seat,
hoping that the lady of the castle, for so
in my fancy I had named her, would
appear again. But the lady did not condescend,
nor did any other human being.
Perhaps they did not know that I was
waiting. Instead, I saw the coming of
the night.</p>

<p>Since that night I have felt pity for
every prisoner in his cell who watches
the approach of darkness. There is so
much friendliness, so much good cheer
and encouragement about the sun that
even the felon must look to him, through
bars though it be, as a friend. Even I,
who was conscious of no crime and had
just eaten a good warm supper, the best
of all tonics, felt my spirits decline with
the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>My window looked to the southwest,
right into the eye of the setting sun. It
was a very big sun and a very red sun,
turning all the mountains into red, its
blazing scarlet dyes rubbing out the
more modest yellows and browns, and
even touching the withered grass with
flame. The red lances of light fell
across the river, and the water foaming
around the mound seemed to break in
bubbles of fire.</p>

<p>Lower sank the sun. One edge of
the flaming globe disappeared behind
the mountains, and a line of dusk began
to creep up under the rim of the red
horizon. It looked like a battle between
night and day, with day losing
despite all the power of its ally, the sun.
Broader grew the band of dusk, and narrower
became the red segment of the
sun. Only the crest of the mountains,
long and sharp like a sword-blade, was
in the light now. There every shrub,
every rock, stood out magnified by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
last but most brilliant light of the sinking
orb. Beneath this luminous ribbon,
trees, rocks, earth, all were gone. The
mountain crests seemed to swim in the
air.</p>

<p>I had seen many sunsets in the mountains,
but never before in such a peculiar
situation, and I own that I felt awed.
The sun became but a red fragment;
the red leaves and the fiery bubbles on
the river were gone. I could hear the
rush of the water, but I could not see
the torrent. I looked up again: the
sun, yielding to the night, had disappeared,
leaving but a faint gleam to mark
where he had retreated behind the mountains,
to come up again in another place,
victorious in his turn, the next morning.
Save for this remembering gleam, the
mountains and the valley were in complete
darkness.</p>

<p>It was dark in my room, too, and it
was only through accustoming my eyes
to the coming of the night that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
able to see the outlines of the scanty
furniture. My spirits were heavy. I
knew nothing of the nature of the man
into whose hands I had fallen, and in
these secluded mountains there was nobody
to help me. You can credit, if
you will, much of this feeling to the
darkness, which often is a wet blanket
upon the feelings not alone of children,
but of grown and experienced men as
well.</p>

<p>It was then with a sensation of relief
that I heard some one fumbling at the
door. Any company would be better
than none. The door opened, and the
colonel entered, followed by the man
who had brought my supper and a third
whom I had not seen before. This new
man was of better dress and presence
than Crothers, and the colonel introduced
him briefly.</p>

<p>"Dr. Ambrose, my military surgeon,
sir, and a very good one too, I can assure
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Crothers put a lighted candle on the
table. Dr. Ambrose examined my swollen
ankle. He bound around it a cloth
soaked in liniment, and said it would be
well in the morning.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said the colonel, speaking
in a brisk, curt manner, "having done
our duty by you as a disabled prisoner,
we will proceed with your examination.
Doctor, it is necessary that this should
be taken in writing. You will kindly
act as clerk while I question the prisoner."</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to protest and to
demand explanation, but the colonel cut
me short with a "Be silent, sir, until the
time comes for you to speak;" and,
rather than be exposed to another such
insult, I remained silent. Moreover, the
scene amused me somewhat. I was
wondering what this strange old man
would do next.</p>

<p>Dr. Ambrose drew up my stool&mdash;I
had taken a seat on the bed&mdash;and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>duced
a roll of paper, pen, and small
ink-well. His was the deliberation of a
military mind provided with time and
bent upon doing things well. The colonel
stood before me, straight and stern.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Arthur West," I replied. "This is
the second answer to the same question."</p>

<p>"Your home?"</p>

<p>"City of New York, State of New
York."</p>

<p>"Your age?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven."</p>

<p>At every question and answer I heard
the scratching of the doctor's industrious
pen across the pad of the paper. Now,
be it understood, I knew no law compelling
me to answer these questions, but
I thought it better to do so, and then I
might see to what end the matter would
come. I smiled a little: the colonel saw
it at once.</p>

<p>"No levity, sir!" he cried, fiercely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"You do not seem to be aware of your
position?"</p>

<p>Perhaps I was not; but I said nothing.</p>

<p>"What were you doing within our
lines in civilian's dress?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Whose lines?" I replied. "I do
not know what you mean."</p>

<p>"The lines of Fort Defiance, the last
stronghold of the Confederacy; which
stronghold I have the honor to command,"
he replied, his ancient blue eyes
lighting up with the fires of zeal.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"The Confederacy!" I said, in derision.
"Why, the last stronghold of the
Confederacy surrendered more than thirty
years ago."</p>

<p>"You lie, sir!" thundered the colonel,
"and for the proof that you lie, look
around you! The stars and bars still
fly above this fort, and I and my men
have never surrendered to the Yankees,
nor ever will. For many hours now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
you have been on the soil of the Confederacy,
and I, for the lack of higher
authorities, am in supreme command,
both civil and military.&mdash;Is not all that I
say true, doctor? Is it not so, Crothers?"</p>

<p>Crothers and the doctor bowed in a
manner indicating deep belief. I saw
that I was to receive neither help nor
sympathy from them.</p>

<p>"What is your occupation?" asked
the colonel.</p>

<p>"I do not see that it is any business
of yours," I said; "but, as I am not
ashamed of my profession, and you may
have saved my life on the mountains,
I've no objection to telling you. I'm an
artist."</p>

<p>At this modest announcement the
colonel's face, to my surprise, became
more threatening. Never did I see a
man's expression more thoroughly betoken
suspicion.</p>

<p>"An artist?" he exclaimed. "You
paint, you draw things?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some of the critics say I don't, but
my friends say I do," I replied.</p>

<p>He grumbled to himself and looked
at me with angry, distrustful eyes.</p>

<p>"What were you doing on these
mountains?" he asked. "Why were
you approaching Fort Defiance?"</p>

<p>"I told you I was on a hunting-trip
and lost myself," I said. "I hadn't the
slightest idea I was approaching Fort
Defiance. I never heard of the place
before."</p>

<p>He pulled his fierce, gray moustache
in doubt, looking at me as if mine were
the most unwelcome face that ever met
his gaze. Presently he beckoned the
doctor to the door, and they whispered
together there for a few moments. Then
he returned to me.</p>

<p>"You have in reality a bad ankle,
the doctor says, and he is inclined to
give you the benefit of the doubt," he
said, "and so am I. At any rate, we
will not treat you badly, though we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
be forced to keep you as a guest for a
little while."</p>

<p>I thanked him for his gracious consideration.</p>

<p>"We are compelled to keep you
locked in to-night," he continued, "but
we may be able to do better for you in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, with some impatience.
"Keep me locked in if you
choose, but at any rate let me sleep."</p>

<p>I thought his rough treatment of me
offset the favor I had owed him. Moreover,
I was very tired and sleepy, and the
obligation of politeness seemed to rest
upon me no longer.</p>

<p>The doctor folded his notes and
handed them to the colonel, who placed
them carefully in an inside pocket.
Then they bowed stiffly, and went out,
locking the door as usual.</p>

<p>I looked out through my window.
The moon was rising above the mountains.
In the valley the foliage was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
tipped with silver. The bubbles on the
river, fire-color at set of sun, had turned
to silver now. Nothing seemed to stir;
all was peace.</p>

<p>Wondering what would be the end of
my strange adventure, I lay down on the
bed, and in five minutes forgot wonder
and all other things in a deep sleep.</p>

<p>I might have slept all the next day
too, but I was awakened by a good
shaking at the hands of Crothers, and
found the room full of light. Crothers
was standing beside me. He was a sour-faced
fellow, but he seemed to be less
hostile that morning, and I asked him
cheerfully if he was going to bring me
my breakfast. He said no, but told me
I was invited to the colonel's own table.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Grace who did it," he said.
"She didn't think the colonel was treating
you just right."</p>

<p>"Miss Grace is the colonel's daughter,
is she not?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>I was sure that the girl I had seen in
the court the evening before was Grace
Hetherill. This invitation looked promising.
The colonel would surely come
to his senses now and act like a man who
knew it was the year of our Lord 1896,
and not 1864. As there was to be a lady
present, I asked for a bath and comb and
brush, as I wished to make myself very
spruce. All these I obtained, finding
that the fort was not without its comforts.
Then, Crothers still my escort
and guide, I went to the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>I was not prepared for the scene of
comfort, even luxury, that met me in the
dining-room. Yet I was not astonished.
The presence of a cultivated young
woman in the year 1896 is responsible
for much. It was a large apartment,
decorated with horns and antlers and
some fine old silver-bound drinking-cups
of a past age. But I had little time for
inspection. The table was set, and the
company was waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>I seemed to pass suddenly from the
position of prisoner to guest, and the
transformation, in seeming at least, was
complete. The colonel, with all the dignity
of Kentucky good blood and the
military life, saluted and introduced me
to his daughter.</p>

<p>"My daughter, Miss Hetherill, Mr.
West of New York, one of the other
side."</p>

<p>I made my best bow. She was
worthy of it. It was the girl I had seen
in the court. No fainting maiden, no
Mariana in the moated grange, was this,
but a tall, red-cheeked girl with brown
eyes, lustrous dark brown hair, and modern
attire. Here was one who had seen
life beyond the walls of Fort Defiance
or its valley. Any fool would have
known it at the first glance. In the
presence of this splendid woman, who
received me with so much tact and
grace, I began to feel as if the father
owed me no apology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The breakfast-table was worthy of
the hostess who poured the coffee for us.
I glanced again at the room. On the
wall, gazing at me with calm eyes, was
a fine portrait of General Lee. Near it
was one of Stonewall Jackson. Farther
on was Jefferson Davis, and as I looked
at the four walls of the room I saw
that the whole Confederacy was present.
Wreathed over the door somewhat after
the fashion of a looped-up curtain was
the Confederate flag.</p>

<p>I wished to ask many questions of
this strange household, but courtesy
forbade it, when I saw that every time
I led the conversation in the direction
of curiosity it was skilfully turned
aside. Instead, we talked of the great
world outside, and made very good
progress, barring a certain unfamiliarity
on the part of the colonel, who spoke as
if all these things were vague and unreal
to him.</p>

<p>There was a wide window at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the room, and I could see that it
was a glorious morning without. The
torrent, thirty feet down, dashed and
sparkled in front of the window, the gay
sunlight falling on it and showing rocks
and pebbles in its clear depths. All the
brilliant colors of late autumn, which I
had admired so much the day before,
reappeared, more dazzling after a brief
eclipse. I knew that the air outside was
tonic like good wine, but there was
enough just then to keep me content in
that breakfast-room, the heart of the lost
Confederacy. The lost Confederacy!
How could I say that, with its president
and ministers and generals looking down
from the walls at me as if all the world
were theirs, while the stars and bars,
under which I had just passed, hung in
loops over the door!</p>

<p>As his daughter and I talked more,
the colonel talked less. Seen in the
light of the morning, his face looked
rather worn, and once when he threw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
yet thick white hair back with his hand
I noticed the scar of a deep wound
across his head. I began to feel sympathy
for him without knowing exactly
why. He rose presently and excused
himself, saying it was time to give his
men some directions for the day. Miss
Hetherill and I dawdled a little over the
coffee-cups, and I took the opportunity
to thank her for her intercession with her
father in my favor. She did not make
light of my thanks or of her act, and
her manner appeared to indicate a belief
on her part that I had been in real danger;
which, however, I had not been
able to persuade myself was so, nor
could I yet.</p>

<p>She asked me if I would look through
the house,&mdash;I noticed she did not call it
fort, and I consented with gladness, saying
I would be pleased to go anywhere
with so fair a guide, which she accepted
with the carelessness of one who had
heard the like before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>She took me into a room she called
the great parlor, and a noble room it
was, too, though here, as elsewhere, the
atmosphere was distinctly military. It
was full thirty feet square, with a vaulted
ceiling of polished oak. Furs were on
the floor and arms on the wall, repeating
rifles, revolvers, bayonets, swords in
much variety.</p>

<p>"It is my father's chief delight to
polish these and to see that they are in
perfect order," she said.</p>

<p>"Miss Hetherill," I said, speaking
suddenly from impulse, "why does your
father cherish this delusion? Why does
he not go and live among his kind?"</p>

<p>I regretted instantly that I had spoken
so, for she turned upon me with a sudden
flash of anger.</p>

<p>"Delusion, sir?" she exclaimed.
"You forget yourself. It is the most
real thing in the world to him. Be
careful how you make use of such expressions
here. I advise you also not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
forget that you are still my father's prisoner."</p>

<p>She spoke with so much earnestness
that I was impressed, more from fear that
I had wounded her feelings than from fear
for myself. I felt confident yet that it
was the year 1896; and that all the
world was at peace, barring the little
wars of England, which don't count.
She took me no further than the great
parlor&mdash;or the armory, if its fit name
be applied. My unfortunate question
seemed to make some change in her
intentions, and she suggested that we
walk outside on the terrace.</p>

<p>It was a delight as keen as any I had
ever felt to step out after imprisonment
into the brilliant sunshine of the free
and open world. Miss Hetherill threw
a light cloak over her shoulders, for
there was a sharp coolness in the air, and
together we strolled over the terrace. I
admired the solidity and strength of
Fort Defiance, though a good-sized mod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>ern
cannon could have knocked it to
pieces with ease, if any one were ever
able to get a cannon over the maze of
mountains that separated this valley from
the remainder of the world. It was impregnable
to attack by small arms, if
well guarded. The drawbridge was still
up, and I spoke of it.</p>

<p>"It is up most of the time," she said,
frankly, "but to-day it will be up more
than usual. That is on your account.
You are to be kept well guarded."</p>

<p>"The current of the river is too swift,"
I said; "but I think I could swim the
moat."</p>

<p>"If you succeeded," she said, "you
would probably starve to death in the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Then I shall remain here," I said.
"I'm glad that I have so good an excuse
for remaining."</p>

<p>I sought to be gallant, but she only
frowned, and I did not attempt it again.
She left me presently, going into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
house, while I continued my stroll in the
crisp, invigorating air. I could take but
a limited walk at best, merely the circuit
of the hill-top, embracing perhaps
a couple of acres around the house.
Within that space I could wander at
will, and no watch seemed to be set upon
me.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="III">CHAPTER III.<br />AN UNLUCKY SKETCH.</h2></div>


<p>The hill projected farther toward the
southwest than in any other direction,
and in my wanderings I came to
that point. Looking back, I obtained a
sweeping view of Fort Defiance, with its
sloping roofs and sombre-hued walls.
At one angle the vines had grown up
and clung against the wall. It was such
a place as I would like to tell about
when I returned to my friends, and, what
was better, I could show it to them in
its real and exact proportions. I had a
pencil and some good white cardboard
in an inside pocket.</p>

<p>I found a good seat on a stone, made
ready with board and pencil, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to study the fort. It was a fine subject
for an artist, and as I sketched the rough
outlines my enthusiasm grew. I had a
brilliant light, which brought out every
curve and angle of the queer building.
Gradually, in my absorption as the picture
spread over the cardboard, I forgot
everything else. I was just putting in
the little brass cannon that commanded
the approach to the fort, when pencil
and picture were snatched violently from
my hands. I sprang up, full of wrath.</p>

<p>The old colonel stood before me, his
face red, and his eyes flashing with indignation.</p>

<p>"You villain of a spy! You damned
Yankee!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Are you
crazy?" I asked. I did not take kindly
to such names, even from the mouth of
an old man.</p>

<p>He was in a great rage, for his next
words choked him. But he got them
out at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"You an innocent hunter!" he cried.
"And you were lost in the mountains!
That's a pretty tale! I suspected you
from the first, you infernal Yankee spy,
and now I have the proof."</p>

<p>I was really afraid the old man would
fall down in a fit, and I began to feel
more sorrow than anger.</p>

<p>"If you'll explain I'm ready to listen,"
I said, resuming my seat on the big stone,
"and when you're through explaining
I'll thank you to give me back my pencil
and sketch."</p>

<p>He seemed to feel the necessity of
self-control, though I could see his anger
was not diminishing.</p>

<p>"You claimed to be a hunter lost in
the mountains," he repeated, "when, in
fact, you are a Yankee spy sent here
upon your miserable business into the
last stronghold of the Confederacy."</p>

<p>I laughed loud and long. I know I
ought not to have done so, but I could
not help it. The blood rose higher in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his cheeks, and his lips trembled, but he
had himself under firm control at last.</p>

<p>"I'm a spy upon you, am I?" I asked,
"Where's the proof?"</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said, holding up my
pencil and sketch of the fort,&mdash;a poor
enough sketch, too. "At the intercession
of my daughter, I have been treating
you this morning as a prisoner of
war, ready for exchange or parole, and
your first use of this hospitality is to
draw for the Yankee government sketches
and maps of my fortifications."</p>

<p>"I did not intend to take that sketch
to Washington," I protested, mildly.</p>

<p>"It is quite certain that you will never
do so," he said, putting sketch and pencil
in his pocket. "I have other uses for
these. Come with me."</p>

<p>"Suppose I decline," I said. I was
growing a little obstinate. Moreover, I
was tired of being hacked about.</p>

<p>He blew a little thing like a policeman's
whistle: three or four men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Confederate uniform came out of the
fort or the little outhouses.</p>

<p>"We will see whether you will come,"
said the colonel, as the men approached.
I have an objection to bruises and undignified
struggles; so I concluded to go.</p>

<p>"If you will kindly lead," I said, "I'll
follow." I am happy to say that I retained
my calmness and presence of mind.</p>

<p>"Come on behind him, Crothers, and
you too, Turner," said the colonel.
"We will take no more chances with
him."</p>

<p>The two men closed up behind me,
the colonel marched on before, and I was
the convict in the middle. Thus we
stalked back into Fort Defiance. Before
I entered the door I saw Grace Hetherill
looking from an upper window; her face
expressed an alarm which I did not feel.
I smiled at her in virtue of our brief
comradeship of the morning, but she did
not smile back: we had stalked out of
view the next moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The colonel led the way to the little
room or cell which I had occupied during
the previous night, and showed me
in, with scant&mdash;very scant&mdash;courtesy.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary to search you,"
he said. "We know not what further
sketches or maps of Fort Defiance you
may have concealed about you."</p>

<p>I think on the whole I am a tolerant
man, but at this proposed indignity my
stomach revolted.</p>

<p>"I will not submit to a search," I said.
"You have no right to do such a thing."</p>

<p>"It is in perfect accordance with the
laws of war," replied the colonel, very
calmly. "Spies are always searched. I
do not see upon what ground you base
your protest."</p>

<p>He looked very determined, and I
recalled the fact that I was opposed to
bruises and undignified struggles. Moreover,
I remembered the consoling fact
that I had a refuge in injured innocence.
When Crothers went through my pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I made no resistance. He found nothing
more dangerous than a penknife, a handkerchief,
and some keys made to fit doors
very far from Fort Defiance.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" I asked the colonel,
when his man had finished.</p>

<p>"For the present," he replied, shortly.
"I will have more to say to you before
long."</p>

<p>He and his men went out. They
seemed to be very careful about fastening
the door, for they spent a deal of time
fumbling with the lock.</p>

<p>I drew my stool up to the window and
took my seat there, beginning my second
imprisonment in the same room; my
second state, so the colonel seemed to
intend, was to be much worse than the
first. The complex character of this old
warrior interested me and aroused my
curiosity; his fierce and somewhat stilted
invective amused me, now that he had
gone from my presence, and I was in a
state of wonder, too, as to what the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the adventure would be. A rare
adventure it was, without doubt, and I
vowed to myself that it should not suffer
in the telling when I returned to my
friends in the city.</p>

<p>Thus amused and surmising, all my
vexation at the colonel's high-handed
treatment and verbal abuse of me departed.
Instead, I wondered how any
man, at the end of thirty years, could
cling so firmly and at such a sacrifice to
a lost and now vain cause. A feeling of
hunger put a stop to this guessing and
wondering. The air of the morning had
been crisp and fresh, and I had worked
hard over my unfortunate picture. I
needed refreshment, and, since I owed
the colonel no politeness, I kicked the
door violently, in the hope that I would
attract some one of his Confederate veterans,
to whom I could give my order.</p>

<p>Though I made a deal of noise, nobody
responded, and I quit kicking. I
was tempted to smash the window, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
rages are exhaustive and ineffective, and
I decided not to do so. At last I concluded
to be a martyr. It is one of the
most consoling of all things to feel that
you are a martyr, and my peace of mind
was restored. I decided that I would
not take the thing seriously, and that
when I left Fort Defiance I would not
upbraid the colonel for his abuse of the
laws of hospitality, so sacred in the
mountains.</p>

<p>I resumed my seat by the window, and
saw Grace Hetherill in the court. She
was looking up at my window, and when
she saw my face there she waved a handkerchief
two or three times and then disappeared
quickly behind the wall. Now,
let it be understood that I had no idea
Grace Hetherill was trying to flirt with
me, but I was sure she had made a signal
of some kind. Perhaps she intended to
encourage me, but I fancied I scarcely
needed that; not in the year of our Lord
and deep peace 1896.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard them fumbling at the door
again. The colonel and two of his men
appeared.</p>

<p>"You will come with us, if you
please," said the colonel, with the stiff,
military courtesy which he had never
abated since his explosion about the picture.</p>

<p>"I trust it is to dinner, colonel," I said,
with some gayety, which I really felt.
"This mountain air of yours breeds
hunger."</p>

<p>He made neither denial nor assent,
but led the way down-stairs. The two
men followed close behind me, as if
bent upon preserving the fiction that I
was a convict or criminal of some kind.
Somewhat to my surprise, the colonel led
the way into the large room which Grace
Hetherill had called the great parlor. A
new arrangement of its furniture had
been made. A long table with chairs
around it had been placed in the centre
of the room, and drooping over it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the ceiling was a large Confederate flag.
Five or six men, including Dr. Ambrose,
all dressed in Confederate gray, were
present.</p>

<p>The colonel saw my astonished and
questioning look, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I told you, Mr. West, that everything
was to be done in accordance with
military law. The Confederacy would
not disgrace itself by acting otherwise.
You are to have a fair trial."</p>

<p>All the men had risen to their feet and
saluted the colonel. I was invited to
take a chair at the foot of the table; all
the others took their seats also. Dr.
Ambrose again acted as secretary, the
colonel presiding, and the court-martial
began.</p>

<p>I saw nothing better than to fall in
with the spirit of the thing. Let me repeat
for the second time that I dislike
bruises and undignified struggles, and I
had no choice. Accordingly, I pulled
a very grave and long face, and sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
silence, awaiting the questions that the
military tribunal might propound to me.</p>

<p>"I think," said the colonel, "it would
be just to give the prisoner a full and
explicit statement of the charge against
him."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," I said. "It would
at least be interesting, if not important."</p>

<p>The colonel frowned at my flippancy.</p>

<p>"You, sir," he said, addressing me,
"who call yourself Arthur West, of
New York City, with what truth we
know not, are accused of entering the
military lines of the Confederacy in
civilian's attire for the purpose of spying
upon our fortifications, armaments, and
other military supplies, and of delivering
such information as you might obtain to
the enemy. Is not that true, sir?"</p>

<p>"The war is over, colonel," I said.
"The Confederacy perished more than
thirty years ago."</p>

<p>"You speak falsely, sir," he said, with
some fierceness. "The war is not over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and the Confederacy has not perished.
See its flag over your head. I hold my
commission from President Jefferson
Davis himself, and certainly I have not
laid down my arms."</p>

<p>I smiled a little, whistled a bar or two,
and gazed at the ceiling. The colonel
looked deeply annoyed at my carelessness.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Mr. West," he said.
"You are not helping your case by your
conduct."</p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, "come to see me
in New York, and I'll show you the
town."</p>

<p>"Enough of such levity," he cried.
"Will you or will you not plead to the
charge?"</p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, "it is the 18th of
November, 1896, and a very fine afternoon."</p>

<p>"I have warned you once already that
you are prejudicing your own case," he
cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I deny the jurisdiction of the tribunal,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Your denial goes for nothing," he
said. "Do not enter it upon the record,
doctor. Will you say what brought
you into these mountains?"</p>

<p>"As I have told you several times," I
said, "I belong to a hunting-party, and
was lost. I did not know I was near
Fort Defiance, nor had I ever heard of
such a place."</p>

<p>"Let that be entered upon the record,
doctor," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"I have it all," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Crothers," said the colonel, "put
upon the table the sketch which I found
the prisoner making this morning."</p>

<p>Crothers obeyed.</p>

<p>"What do you call that?" said the
colonel to me.</p>

<p>"I would call that," I replied, "a
pretty bad picture of Fort Defiance."</p>

<p>My tone was light, and, as usual, my
levity seemed to displease the colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
very much. He warned me for the
third time that I was injuring my
chances, but I was not impressed.</p>

<p>"That sketch," said he, "shows the
situation and fortifications of Fort Defiance.
You were found drawing it surreptitiously.
I ask you again, what have
you to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, colonel," I replied, "except
that when we dine together in New
York we will discuss its artistic merits or
lack of them."</p>

<p>The colonel ran his hand impatiently
through his hair, and again uncovered
the scar of the deep wound on his head.
I wondered in what battle he had received
it, and had a mind to ask him
whenever opportunity made the question
pertinent.</p>

<p>"Make proper entries on the record,"
he said to the doctor, "that the prisoner
will give only irrelevant answers to our
questions."</p>

<p>"It has been done," said the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The door of the room was opened at
that moment, and Miss Hetherill appeared.
Her father rose hastily, and his
manner showed that he was disconcerted.</p>

<p>"You must retire at once, Grace," he
said. "I forbade your presence here."</p>

<p>"Father," she said, "you must stop
these proceedings. You must not harm
Mr. West."</p>

<p>I rose and bowed in my best manner.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your intercession,
Miss Hetherill," I said, "but I can protect
myself."</p>

<p>She turned her whole attention to her
father, neglecting me. I resumed my
seat and looked out of the window,
that I might appear to take no notice in
case a family jar occurred. It is an immense
satisfaction to have a pretty girl
interfere in one's behalf, and I was content
merely to look out at the river and
the yellowing leaves.</p>

<p>The colonel took his daughter by
the arm and told her again she must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
withdraw. She protested, but in tones
too low for me to hear the exact words.
The colonel was becoming much excited.
The matter was ended speedily
by the withdrawal of Miss Hetherill, in
which I think she was wise, for the
gentlemen conducting my court-martial
seemed to have made up their minds
to go on with the business. This was
shown the more clearly to me because
when she went out the colonel locked
the door. I did not see him do it, as I
kept my eyes on out-of-doors, but I heard
the key turning in the lock.</p>

<p>"Attention, sir!" said the colonel.</p>

<p>I was observing then some beautiful
splashes of red and yellow on the
mountain foliage, which appealed to my
love of color, and I did not turn my
head.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, sir," said the colonel,
provoked, as I meant him to be.
"Will you plead to this very grave
charge against you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, "it is a splendid
afternoon for a walk, and we might get
a fine view from the crest of the ridge
yonder. Shall we take a stroll up there
together?"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the colonel, "we
have given the prisoner every opportunity
to speak, and he will not take advantage
of it. There is nothing further for the
court to do but to render its verdict."</p>

<p>All the men except the colonel and
the doctor withdrew to the far end of
the room. They talked together a few
moments, and then returned to us,
Crothers at their head.</p>

<p>"What is your verdict, Mr. Crothers?"
asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"Death," replied Crothers.</p>

<p>"So say you all?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"So say we all," they said.</p>

<p>"May the Lord have mercy on his
soul," added the colonel, in the tone of
a judge.</p>

<p>"You seem to be agreed, gentlemen,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
I said, looking around from the window.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said the colonel.
"Mr. Secretary, see that the sentence of
the court is entered upon the record."</p>

<p>"It has been done," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>"Then if you have amused yourselves
sufficiently, gentlemen," I said, "I would
like to go back to my room, as I am
tired. I'd thank you also to send me
something to eat, as I am hungry, too."</p>

<p>"That much courtesy is due you,"
said the colonel.</p>

<p>Rising, he led the way, and two of
the men closed in behind me, according
to the prescribed rule. Thus we marched
back to my room, where I was locked
in and left to wait for food, spending
such time as I chose meanwhile in reflections
upon the fate of a man condemned
to death, an advantage that I
had never enjoyed in the first person before.
I can say with the utmost respect
for the truth that my chief sensation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
still one of curiosity. I was not accustomed
to such adventures, and, as I
knew of no precedents, I could make no
predictions.</p>

<p>All such thoughts were interrupted by
the arrival of Crothers with my supper;
and I perceived that a man under sentence
of death may become as hungry
as one with freedom and many years
to enjoy. While Crothers spread the
banquet, another soldier walked up and
down in the hall, and just before Crothers
shut the door I caught the steel-blue
of his rifle-barrel. Evidently they
were keeping a good guard over me,
which seemed to me a waste of thought
and strength. But they had kept in
mind the principle that it costs nothing
to be courteous to a dying man, and
had sent me a most excellent repast,
from which the prospect of dying took
no sauce.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crothers," said I, as I poured a
cup of hot coffee and sniffed the aroma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of a piece of fresh and well-cooked
venison, all mine, "how long have you
served Colonel Hetherill?"</p>

<p>"I enlisted in his regiment in '61,"
replied Crothers, "and he's still my commanding
officer. That makes thirty-five
years by my reckoning."</p>

<p>"How much longer do you expect to
serve him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Until the war is over," he replied,
briefly.</p>

<p>Evidently here was a man of the
colonel's own mind and temper.</p>

<p>The very good dinner put me in an
excellent humor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crothers," I asked, "am I to be
shot or hanged?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask the colonel," he
replied, "though I think it's commoner
to hang spies than to shoot 'em."</p>

<p>He spoke in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crothers," I began again, "do
you think I am alarmed?"</p>

<p>"I'd be in your place," he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>After this I could not get him to continue
any form of debate. He merely
sat in obstinate silence while I finished
the supper. To mark my disapproval
of his manners, I turned my back upon
him and resumed my old occupation
of gazing out of the window. My sentence
of death had made no change in
the prospect. The lights and colors on
mountain and forest were as vivid as
ever. Where the edges of the dying
leaves had turned red, the forest glowed
as with fire; then came patches of soft
brown, and beyond were streaks of yellow
gold. It was a beautiful world,
unhurt by its wildness.</p>

<p>Crothers took up the tray of empty
dishes, and bade me a polite good-night,
which I returned without bad feeling.
I was rather glad he had gone, since a
man who will not talk to me when I
want to talk to him annoys me.</p>

<p>While the sun was setting and the
night coming on to take its place, I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to decide how I would avenge myself
upon Colonel Hetherill for his treatment
of me. To me it seemed a somewhat
complicated question, as he had certainly
saved my life, though the saving of it
gave him no right to the taking of it,
and if I injured him I would be sure to
injure his daughter, who undoubtedly
had shown consideration for me. I gave
it up, leaving the problem to its own
solution, and continued to sit by the
window, looking out at nothing. Thus
importantly occupied, I heard the usual
fumbling at the door which betokened a
visitor. I was guessing whether it would
be the colonel or Crothers, when I saw
it was neither, but Grace Hetherill.
She stopped to close the door very carefully,
and when she turned to me she
showed excitement. I had risen and was
preparing to make the compliments custom
demands from a young man to a
young woman, when she exclaimed, in
nervous tones,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. West, you must escape from
this house to-night!"</p>

<p>"Escape, Miss Hetherill?" I said.
"Where would I go? It is comfortable
here, although my movements are somewhat
restricted. But out there in those
wild mountains I would starve to death."</p>

<p>I spoke lightly, but my manner seemed
to increase her apprehensions. She came
closer and put her hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. West," she said, "you do not
yet understand your situation and its
dangers."</p>

<p>"I see no occasion for alarm, Miss
Hetherill," I said. "Your father has
gratified his whim, and I shall not complain
of the trouble he has caused me.
It might be made a rough sort of jest for
him if I carried the news to Washington;
but I see no reason why I should
do so."</p>

<p>I felt her hand grip my arm in her
excitement.</p>

<p>"This is no play, no jest!" she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
"Do you think that my father looks
upon this fort, the weapons in it and the
flag over it, as a mere whim? They
are the most real of all things to him."</p>

<p>I was impressed by her earnestness and
strong feeling. I was about to say that
if her father looked upon such things as
realities I was sorry for him, but I remembered
that I should not speak so
bluntly to her father's daughter.</p>

<p>"I tell you they are realities!" she
exclaimed. "It is a reality that you are
held a prisoner here, a condemned spy;
and it is a reality that you are to be shot
as such at nine o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"What? Is this the truth?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Crothers and another man are digging
your grave now," she said.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I asked, still
partly incredulous.</p>

<p>"I have seen them at work," she replied.</p>

<p>I was more impressed than ever. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
leave it to all if it is not a trifle hard
upon a man's nerves to receive the news
that other men are digging his grave for
him. Moreover, her manner left no
doubts. I was seized with a sudden
shudder of the nerves and chill of the
blood. I saw that this fanatical old
colonel would carry out his farce to the
end, and that end was my execution.</p>

<p>"Do you believe me now?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but what am I to do?" I said,
in despair.</p>

<p>"You must leave Fort Defiance to-night,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Am I to go up through the roof or
down through the floor?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Do not jest with your danger," she
replied, both reproof and reproach in her
voice.</p>

<p>"But when you speak of escape, I see
no way to obey you, Miss Hetherill," I
said.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that I am without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
influence in my father's house?" she
said, with some haughtiness. "I have
prepared the way, and will lead. You
have nothing to do but follow me."</p>

<p>She opened the door again, and I saw
that no guard was in the hall. It was
not a time to waste energy upon one's
baggage or mode of taking leave, and
without ado I followed her.</p>

<p>"Step as lightly as you can," she said.</p>

<p>I was willing enough to obey her.
She had made me see the truth about
her father, and while I was opposed to
death under any circumstances I wished
least of all to face it very early on a cold
morning, and perhaps have my body tumbled
into a ditch afterward. This, too, in
the year of peace 1896. Accordingly, I
shod my feet with felt. We passed from
the upper hall to the lower in safety, and
reached the front door. Then I saw that
in fact she had prepared the way for me.
No guard was there, nor did she even
need to unlock any bolts. She pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the door open, and in rushed a flood of
the cool night air. I knew then that the
wind of heaven was the wind of freedom.</p>

<p>The outside of Fort Defiance seemed
to be, like the inside, without guards.
The river plashed and gurgled in the
dusk, and the dry leaves rustled as the
wind blew them upon one another, but
that was all. The fort seemed to be
asleep. The muzzle of the little brass
cannon that swept the drawbridge was
hidden in the darkness, and the cannon
was without threat.</p>

<p>Miss Hetherill left me at the door a
few moments, and when she returned
she thrust into my hands a military
knapsack which seemed to be well filled.</p>

<p>"It contains food," she said: "you will
need it."</p>

<p>I hung the knapsack over my shoulder
and followed her, for she was already
leading the way to the drawbridge,
which was down and unguarded. A
few steps took us across. I looked back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at Fort Defiance, a solid dark mass, no
light anywhere showing that it was tenanted.</p>

<p>"Miss Hetherill," I said, and I was
speaking sincerely, "you have done
much for me, and I am very grateful,
but do not go any farther. I can find
my way now, and I will say good-by to
you here."</p>

<p>"No," she said; "I will take you out
of the valley and put you on your road."</p>

<p>Her tone did not admit of protest, and
without a word I followed her. She led
the way across the valley directly toward
the nearest mountain slope. I will admit
that on this journey I was cherishing
a feeling of satisfaction. It is not
only pleasant to have a pretty girl interest
herself in one's behalf, but still pleasanter,
if one's life must be saved at all,
to have it saved by that same pretty girl.</p>

<p>At the point to which we were trending,
the first slope of the mountain was
not distant more than half a mile. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
path was clear, and we were soon there.
I felt like uttering my thanks again, but
such words seemed so futile that I remained
silent.</p>

<p>"Keep to the southwest," said Miss
Hetherill. "Don't forget that. Watch
the sun to-morrow, and remember always
to travel to the southwest. If you do
that you will reach the settlements before
your food is exhausted."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Hetherill," I said.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said she.</p>

<p>She was standing before me, and she
looked so fair in the moonlight that I
stooped down suddenly and kissed her.</p>

<p>I do not know why I did it, I had
known her only a day or so, but I had
no apologies to make then, and I will
make none now.</p>

<p>She stared at me a moment, her face
quite red. Then, without speaking, she
turned and walked swiftly toward Fort
Defiance, while I slowly climbed the
first slopes of the mountains.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>







<h2 id="IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />AMONG THE PEAKS.</h2></div>


<p>Some yards up I came to a ledge, upon
which I sat and took another look
at Fort Defiance. I saw a light figure
cross the drawbridge, and then up went
the bridge itself. I resumed my journey,
half walking, half climbing, and a half-hour
later, when I looked back again,
I was much astonished to see lights
blazing at every window of Fort Defiance.
I watched for some minutes, but
I was too far away to see figures moving
or anything else that would tell me the
cause of the lights.</p>

<p>Convinced that it was no time for idle
curiosity about illuminations, I turned
my face toward the southwest, deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>mined
to carry out my instructions.
Yet I saw readily that my problem was
not yet wholly solved. I had escaped
from the fort, but I had not escaped
from the mountains, which at that hour
looked very dark, very bleak, and very
lonely. I picked out a large clear star
burning in the southwest just above the
tip of the highest peak, and made it my
guide.</p>

<p>It was rough travelling, but the night
was cold, and my limbs had been stiffening
in confinement. The sharp air and
the exercise were a tonic to me. The
blood ran freely through my veins, and
I felt strong and buoyant. I resolved
to walk all night, a resolution born partly
of necessity, for I could not lie down
and sleep without finding every joint
stiffened in the morning by cold.</p>

<p>With my eyes fixed on my star, I
tramped steadily to the southwest. It was
not an especially dark night, but I kept
as closely as I could to the valleys or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
rifts, and the up-lift of the peaks above
me hid half the skies. I am not superstitious,
and I think I possess at least
average courage, but the silence and solemnity
of the mountains awed me and
made me lonely and afraid. I seemed
to be alone in the universe, save for the
misty peaks, which nodded to each other
and never noticed me. It may be flattering
to one's vanity to feel that he is
the only man in the world, but it soon
grows tiresome. I longed for company,
a chum, somebody to talk to me.</p>

<p>I may be skilful in analyzing the
feelings of others, but I have little success
with my own. As the chill loneliness
thickened around me, I wished
again for Fort Defiance. Out of danger
now, the danger that I had been
in seemed so little, incredible perhaps.
After all, I might have yielded too
easily to a frightened girl's fears. But
she had been frightened on my account.
That was a tender thought. I smiled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the darkness at the thought and the
memory of that early kiss, for which I
was not sorry.</p>

<p>The cold darkness of the mountains
and the warm walls of Fort Defiance
began to contend for first place in my
mind. The belief that in the flush of
the interview with his daughter I had
overrated the fanaticism of the colonel
grew, and my sense of loneliness egged
it on until it became conviction.</p>

<p>The strength and courage which I had
felt at the start waned. The cold slid
into my bones and chilled the marrow.
I sat for a few moments on a big stone
at the bottom of a great cleft, that I
might rest myself. Over the knife-edge
of the tallest ridge, a moon very white
and cold looked at me as if wondering
what I was doing in an otherwise deserted
world. To this I could return no
answer. All my intentions were failing;
I was uncertain of myself. The advice
to me to push on continually to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
southwest had been clear and decisive, and
I had been following it most diligently
for at least three hours. But there was
my star in the southwest burning as
brilliantly as ever and also as far away
as ever. Above me were the dusky
skies, the moon calm and cold, and
about me was the wilderness. I shut my
eyes and saw my room in Fort Defiance,
a cell still, but sheltered and warm.</p>

<p>The wind began to blow. It had a
sharp edge of ice, and I shivered. Then
I sprang up in fright as a great groan
came down the cleft, passed me, and
went on among the mountains, through
valley and valley, between cliff and cliff,
and from peak to peak. I knew, after
my first start, what it was, but it frightened
me as if it had been a ghost,
though I am a full-grown man, and, as I
said before, I think I have at least average
courage. It was the wind, gathered
and compressed in the narrow deep
ravines between the tall cliffs, and driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on by other winds behind, until it cried
out like a man in deadly pain. Not
until then, when the mountains were
awake and groaning, did I comprehend
how deep and intense may become the
sense of desolation. I had noticed the
wonderful repetition of the echoes when
I fired my rifle to attract the attention of
the colonel, but at night these echoes
were deepened and carried faster from
peak to peak and ridge to ridge. As
the wind gained in strength and swept
through the trees and bushes on the
slopes and crests as well as through the
ravines and valleys, new tones were
added, and I listened to the chorus of the
mountains. The groan changed to a
deep bass; with it were mingled the
flutter and rustle of the dry leaves as the
wind blew them together, leaf on leaf,
and the higher note of a wandering
breeze as it escaped from a ravine and
swept triumphantly over ridge and peak.</p>

<p>I was content to listen awhile to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
music of the mountains, but I found
that my joints were growing stiff with
cold. One needs more than music,
however sublime, on a dark night in
November, unsheltered save by the skies.
I took out some food, ate it, and resumed
my journey without much courage,
however, I will confess. My star was
still there, but, like the moon, it was unsympathetic
and cold, and it travelled
due southwest as fast as I.</p>

<p>I think I was a bit shaken by my situation
and my inability to drive away
the sense of desolation. It is easy
enough to say that superstition and all
such kindred things are folly, as perhaps
they are; but put a man down where I
was, let him go through what I had gone
through, and he will have a ghost gibbering
at him from every peak. So,
when I saw a light flaming on a crest
where no light had been before, I was
not at all sure whether I saw it with eyes
real or imaginary. It was no star; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
flame was too bright, too red, and flickered
too much, for that. Presently a
light blazed up on another hill-top, and
then on a third, and then on a fourth.
They were moved about as if signalling
to each other, and I was positive that I
was growing light-headed. It would require
no common, normal pair of eyes
to see so many lights dancing a jig. All
the hill-tops seemed to be afire, and I
was quite sure that was not natural.</p>

<p>The sound of a trumpet, loud, clear,
and penetrating, mingled with the song
of the winds, and swept through the
mountains, echo after echo. The military
note rose above all the rest, and
there by the first light, which formed the
background for it and made it visible, I
saw a human figure. I had no doubt that
this was the man who blew the trumpet,
and it meant that the colonel and his
men were seeking to retake me. The
trumpet was blown again, and all the
lights except the first were extinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>As I said, I am unable to analyze
myself, and while a few moments ago I
wished to be back at Fort Defiance, I
wished nothing of the kind now that I
knew the colonel and his men were seeking
to take me there. I pushed myself
among some bushes, determined that I
would escape.</p>

<p>With mountain heaped on mountain
and the night helping, it would seem
that it was an easy enough matter for
me to escape; but I was not so sure. I
had followed perforce some sort of path
or trace, because it was the only way in
which I could go, and doubtless these
men knew the way well.</p>

<p>The trumpets blew one more blast,
and from my covert I saw the last
light extinguished. Listening intently, I
could hear only the sob of the wind
down the great slash in the mountains,
at the bottom of which I lay. I supposed
that the flaming up of the lights
and the blowing of the trumpets had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
been some sort of signal to draw the
men together. I rose, but I could not
see them either. I thought once of trying
to climb the side of the mountain,
but I feared a stumble or a slip, the noise
of which would draw them to me. I
pressed farther back into the bushes, but
just as I made myself snug several men
turned the angle of the ravine, and one
of them held up a bright lantern. Its
flame fell directly upon me.</p>

<p>"Take aim," shouted the colonel.</p>

<p>The six who were with him covered
me with their rifles. But I had no desire
to be shot.</p>

<p>"It's all right, colonel," I said. "I'll
surrender. I'm your prisoner."</p>

<p>He ordered the men to lower their
weapons. I walked out of the bushes
toward the colonel. There was some
comfort in the company of my kind,
even if I was to be the prisoner and they
the free men, an inequality which I
thought was not deserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"We retook you more easily than we
thought," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"Then double my debt of gratitude
to you, colonel," I said. "You may
have saved me again from death by starvation."</p>

<p>He said nothing to this, and I added,
"Suppose we rest a little. I am tired."</p>

<p>My bones in truth were weary; we
were a long way from Fort Defiance, and
the road was rough. I contemplated the
journey with dismay.</p>

<p>The colonel, who seemed to be
highly pleased at my recapture, was in
good temper. He took a long flask
from his inside pocket and shook it. A
cheerful gurgle came forth. He drew
the cork with a loud plunk, and a pleasant
odor permeated the air.</p>

<p>"Try that," he said, holding out the
flask.</p>

<p>I tried it, and great was the result
thereof. As the rich red liquor trickled
down my throat, I could feel strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
flowing back into muscle and bone, and
a warm glow crept through all the veins
of my chilled body.</p>

<p>I handed the flask back to the colonel
with my heart-felt thanks.</p>

<p>"I think I will try a little myself," he
said, and the pleasant gurgle was heard
again.</p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, "you may shoot
me to-morrow, but for heaven's sake
don't make me walk all the way back
to Fort Defiance to-night."</p>

<p>The liquor had put him in a still
better humor.</p>

<p>"I will not," he said. "Besides, I am
tired myself."</p>

<p>He gave a few directions to his men,
and they began to gather brushwood,
which was scattered about in abundance.
They heaped it up in a sheltered corner
of the ravine, and the colonel, taking the
candle out of his lantern, touched the
flame to the dry boughs. Up it blazed,
and, the wind catching it, the eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
flame leaped from bough to bough. The
wood snapped and cracked as the fire
seized it, and the blaze, rising high, threw
its warm and friendly light upon our faces.</p>

<p>Though a captive and with only twelve
hours or so of life before me, according
to the colonel's limitations, I achieved
comfort. I made myself at home, and,
pulling up a billet, sat down on it before
the fire, where body and eyes could feast
on its warmth and light.</p>

<p>The fire by contrast made the darkness
beyond its radius darker. The
colonel shivered, and then imitated my
example, turning his palms to the flames.</p>

<p>"Makes me think of the winter of
'64," he said.</p>

<p>"Which was a long time ago," I replied.</p>

<p>"But it may come again," said he.</p>

<p>"Never," said I; "the cause is dead
and buried, colonel, and the mourners
are few at this late day."</p>

<p>He turned his head away impatiently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
as if he would not argue with a prisoner.
His men kept silent too. I had hoped
they would hear, but I could not say.
They as well as I had brought food with
them: we broke bread and ate.</p>

<p>The fire, which rose yards high, and
crackled as it ate into the wood, threw
streaks of light on the near slopes. Beyond,
the darkness had settled down over
peak and ridge, and the moon was behind
a veil of clouds. The wind, rising
again, moaned loudly down the ravine
and swept the dry leaves before it. I
would not have escaped if I could.</p>

<p>"Winter will soon be here," said
Crothers, who sat on one side of me.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's as well," said Colonel
Hetherill. "It will make it the harder
for any enemy to reach Fort Defiance."</p>

<p>A blast of wind struck me on the
back of the neck and slipped down my
collar like a stream of ice-water. I
edged up within scorching distance of
the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is cold," said the colonel, replying
to my thought as if I had spoken aloud.
He too edged up to the fire, and all his
men did likewise. No one regarded me
with hostile eyes. For the moment the
military laws of the Confederacy rested
lightly. I don't understand how people
can fight in the dark and when it's at
zero.</p>

<p>Our faces were warm,&mdash;a little too
warm, perhaps,&mdash;but our backs were
cold. I suggested to the colonel that
we build another fire a few yards off and
sit between the two. He looked at me
approvingly, and even said nothing when
I helped to gather brushwood for the
second fire, just as if I were one of the
party and could go and come where I
wished. While I was busy thus, I noticed
that he was looking at me very
intently and twisting his long white
moustache as if he were in doubt. I
guessed that he would have something
to say to me soon; and I was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
wrong. We lighted the second heap of
wood, and the blaze sputtered and roared
as if it would outdo its comrade ten yards
away. We lolled in the heat for a few
minutes, and then the colonel, as I had
expected he would, beckoned to me.</p>

<p>We went on the far side of the second
fire, where none of the men would hear us.</p>

<p>"What is it, colonel?" I asked, politely.
"Can I help you in any way?"</p>

<p>"You can," he replied, "and in helping
me you will help yourself at the
same time."</p>

<p>"Then it ought to be easy for us to
strike a bargain," I said.</p>

<p>"I want some information from you,"
said the colonel. "Your escape was
discovered soon after it was made, but
that escape would not have been possible
without assistance. Name the man to
me, and I will spare your life; I will
send you back to your own country."</p>

<p>My first impulse was to speak violently.
This was the first time he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
touched the quick. But unrestrained
anger is seldom worth the while.</p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, "I may be a Yankee
spy, as you call me, but you can
scarcely expect me to tell you that."
Nor would I have told him, even had
not the traitor been his own daughter.</p>

<p>The colonel looked confused, and
hesitated. Presently he said, "I should
not have made you the offer, and I
apologize; perhaps I have underestimated
you."</p>

<p>This was not very flattering, as it
could be construed different ways, but
I thanked him nevertheless, and we went
back to our good position between the
fires. The colonel was silent and looked
thoughtful. I guessed that he was trying
to divine the traitor and would not
let the matter drop.</p>

<p>I had eaten heartily, and the food, the
heat, and the weariness together made a
strong soporific. My head nodded, and
my eyelids drooped. The colonel, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
looked as if he would like to go to sleep.
The men had blankets with them, and I
made a proposition.</p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, "give me a blanket
and let me go to sleep. You needn't
guard me; I pledge you my word I
won't attempt to escape to-night."</p>

<p>He took one look at the banked-up
darkness. The wind made a long moan
down the ravine.</p>

<p>"I don't think you will try it," he said,
dryly. "Crothers, give him a blanket."</p>

<p>Crothers tossed me the blanket. I
rolled myself in it and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Far in the night I awoke. I might
have gone back to sleep again in a moment
or two, but a bough burned
through fell into the ashes, sending up a
shower of sparks. I held open my
sleepy eyes and looked around at the
colonel's little army, which to the last
man lay stretched upon its back or side
fast asleep. Two high privates were even
snoring. The wind was still strong, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
its groans as it swept through the ravine
rose to a shriek. The fires had burned
down a bit, and were masses of red
coals.</p>

<p>Colonel Hetherill was lying next to
me. The light from the fire fell directly
upon his thin, worn, old face. In my
soul I felt pity for him. His exposed
hands looked chilled, and his blanket
seemed light for a man whose blood had
been thinned by age. My own blanket
was heavy and wide. I threw the corner
of it over him, and in another minute
I yielded again to sleep.</p>

<p>I was the last to awake in the morning,
and I do not know how much
longer I would have slept had not the
colonel pulled me violently by the
shoulder. The sun was risen already
above the mountains, and peak and
ravine shone in the light. One of the
men had produced some coffee and a
small tin coffee-pot, and was making the
best of all morning drinks over the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Another was frying strips of bacon.
Evidently the Confederate army meant
to treat itself well. I sniffed the pleasing
aromas, bethinking me that as the only
prisoner present I was entitled to my
share.</p>

<p>The colonel did not neglect me.
When my turn came the tin cup filled
with coffee was passed me, and I ate my
due allotment of the bacon. The colonel,
however, was stiff and restrained.
His military coolness returned with the
daylight, and his little army reflected his
manners. My attempts at conversation
were repelled, and soon it became apparent
to me that I was the condemned
spy again.</p>

<p>The day was cold, but very bright and
well suited for our rough walking. The
breakfast ended, we abandoned the fires,
which still glowed red in the ravine, and
began our return to Fort Defiance,
Crothers leading the army, while I
walked in the centre of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Ours was a silent walk. If their feelings
had changed with the day, so had
mine. I regretted that I had not escaped.
In the bright sunlight the
mountains did not look so unfriendly
and formidable. But I made up my
mind to ask few questions and to abide
the issue.</p>

<p>Near noon I saw the same column of
smoke which had once been such a
cheering sight to me, and in a quarter of
an hour more I looked down on Fort
Defiance and its peaceful valley. The
place had lost none of its beauty. The
glow of red and brown and yellow in
the foliage was as bright and as deep as
ever. The little river was fluid silver in
the sunshine. We paused a few moments
at the last slope to rest a little:
the quiet landscape, set like a vase in the
mountains, seemed to appeal to Colonel
Hetherill as it appealed to me. We were
standing a little apart from the others.
I said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is too much like a country-seat,
colonel, to be invaded by an enemy."</p>

<p>"I thought once it was secure from
invasions," he said, looking at me suspiciously,
"but since there are traitors
within my own walls I must prepare for
anything."</p>

<p>He spoke as if he intended to make
trouble about the matter, and, since I
had no fit reply, I said nothing. We
descended into the valley, and when we
crossed the drawbridge we met Grace
Hetherill standing at the door. She expressed
no surprise, but looked at me
reproachfully. I felt that she wronged
me, for certainly I had tried to escape.</p>

<p>I was sent to a new room, much like
the other, but with a heavier door. The
window, well cross-barred, looked out,
like all the other windows, upon the
mountains. When I had been locked
up an hour Miss Hetherill came.</p>

<p>"You see I am back, Miss Hetherill,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I said, jauntily. "Who comes oftener
than I?"</p>

<p>"Why did you not escape when I
gave you the chance?" she said, with
the utmost reproach in her voice.</p>

<p>I felt hurt at her manner. I knew
she was thinking less of my death than
of her father's responsibility for it. I
hold myself to be of some value, and
did not wish to be cheapened in any
such manner.</p>

<p>"I did my best to escape, Miss
Hetherill," I said, "but the activity of
the Confederate army was too great for
me."</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with such anger that
I saw my mistake at once.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I said. "I will
not jest again at the colonel's faith."</p>

<p>"I have come to tell you," she said,
"that you are in as much danger as you
were yesterday. I do not think my
father will alter his sentence."</p>

<p>"But first," I said, "he is going to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
out the traitor who helped me to escape
last night."</p>

<p>I supposed, of course, that she would
tell him her part in it, having nothing to
fear, and I was surprised when she answered
me.</p>

<p>"He has been endeavoring to ascertain
it already," she said, "but has failed.
He thinks Dr. Ambrose is the man, and
both the doctor and I are willing for the
present to let him think so. You will
under no circumstances tell him that it
was I. Will you promise me that?"</p>

<p>"I will promise, since you ask it, but
it seems strange, Miss Hetherill."</p>

<p>"It is because I wish to be free to help
you. If my father knew it was I he
would lock me up until you were&mdash;were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Executed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it, though I did not like
to say it."</p>

<p>I could not say no to such a plan, for
I valued my life, and any one in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
place would have been acute enough to
see that Grace Hetherill would be the
most powerful friend I could have inside
of Fort Defiance. The doctor too
must be weakening in his Confederate
faith, if he were willing for my sake to
rest under his commanding officer's suspicion.
But that might be done for
love. Pshaw! he was too old.</p>

<p>I thanked her very earnestly for her
endeavors to save me.</p>

<p>"I will seek to delay action on my
father's part," she said. "Our chief
hope rests in that."</p>

<p>I trusted that she would secure the delay,
indefinite delay. When the door was
opened for her to leave I saw a sentinel
on guard in the hall, and became convinced
that the colonel was taking very
few chances with me.</p>

<h2 id="V">CHAPTER V.<br />A CHANGE OF SITUATIONS.</h2></div>


<p>Crothers as usual brought me my
meals, and in that respect I was well
treated. The night passed without event,
and the next morning I was allowed to
take a walk around the fort between
Crothers and another soldier, but I saw
nothing of either the colonel or his
daughter. I tried to pump Crothers,
but he was proof against my most skilful
questions, and when I returned to
my room I could boast no increase of
knowledge. Yet I was not much depressed.
I comforted myself with the
old reflection that it was the year of
peace 1896, and I would not become
really alarmed until I stood up before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a file of the colonel's men and looked
into the muzzles of their rifles.</p>

<p>I received a visit the next morning
from the colonel himself. His manner
was still of a piece with that he had
shown on the return march from the
mountains, marked by a certain haughtiness
and reserve differing much from the
fiery temperament characteristic of him.</p>

<p>"Well, am I to be shot to-day, colonel?"
I asked, and I think I asked it
cheerfully, for, mark you, I had returned
to my old state of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Not to-day," he said. "I have decided
to postpone it until I find out
where the treason in my garrison lies.
You can see that your death might be
in the way of my investigation."</p>

<p>I could see it with ease, and I was
glad that it was so.</p>

<p>He asked me a lot of questions which
he intended to be adroit, but I saw their
drift clearly enough, and led him further
astray. When he was through he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
less than ever about my rescuer, and I let
him think it was one of his men.</p>

<p>"I shall discover the man by to-morrow,"
he said, with a show of confidence
which was but a show, "and his fate
shall be severe enough to put a stop to
any leanings others may have the same
way."</p>

<p>Three days more passed in this manner.
I was permitted to take two walks
daily around the fort in the company of
Crothers and another man, but, as before,
I could obtain no information from
them, and I remained in ignorance of
the colonel's progress or lack of progress
with his secret service.</p>

<p>On the fourth day my door was abruptly
thrown open, and Grace Hetherill
entered. Her face showed great excitement.
The door was not closed behind
her, but stood wide open, and I noticed
that no sentry was in the hall. I was
convinced that something of importance
had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. West," she said, "we need your
help."</p>

<p>"My help," I exclaimed, involuntarily.
"How can I, who need it so much
myself, give anybody help?"</p>

<p>"But you can," she cried. "There is
trouble in Fort Defiance."</p>

<p>Then, her first flush of excitement
over, she told me the story calmly. She
was not long in the telling.</p>

<p>Her hint to her father that Dr. Ambrose
might have been the man who
assisted in my escape had produced
greater results than she expected. The
old colonel had watched the doctor
closely, and at last had accused him of
treason to the Confederate government.
Thereupon the doctor, who was superior
in intelligence and information to the
other men, and knew what was passing
in the world, had advised him to free me,
and to haul down the stars and bars, as
the cause was lost beyond the hope of
revival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father flew into a terrible rage,"
said Grace. "He ordered that Dr. Ambrose
be locked up at once, and it is his
intention to have him shot when he
shoots you."</p>

<p>"Miss Hetherill," I said, "you must
tell your father that Dr. Ambrose had
nothing to do with my escape."</p>

<p>"That would do no good now," she
said, "and might do harm. It would
not help Dr. Ambrose, for my father
regards his proposition to surrender as
the worst treason of all, and if I were to
say that it was I and not the doctor who
helped you, he would not believe me."</p>

<p>This put a new phase on the matter.
I felt very sorry for the doctor, who had
got himself into trouble on my account.
I did not know what to say, but Miss
Hetherill interpreted my look.</p>

<p>"Do not fear for Dr. Ambrose," she
said. "Some of the men have begun
to be of his way of thinking, and my
father will not be able to carry out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sentence against either the doctor or
you."</p>

<p>I understood at once. A revolt was
threatened in the camp, and her fear was
neither for the doctor nor for me, but for
her father. I felt rather cheap.</p>

<p>"I will help you all I can, Miss
Hetherill," I said, a little stiffly, "but I
fail to see anything that I can do. As
you know, I am a prisoner here."</p>

<p>"But you are not as strictly guarded
as you were," she said. "My father's
rage against Dr. Ambrose has withdrawn
his attention from you, and within a day
you may have another chance to escape.
He wants you to come now and testify
against Dr. Ambrose."</p>

<p>"I cannot do that," I said.</p>

<p>"I do not want you to do so," she
said, quickly. "You must say that you
made your escape without help, that you
picked the lock of your door,&mdash;or anything
else you choose to say."</p>

<p>It was a falsehood she asked me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
tell, but I was willing to tell it, since the
interests of four persons were involved
in it,&mdash;hers, the doctor's, mine, and, not
least of all, the colonel's. Truly my
coming had aroused a mighty commotion
in the house of Colonel Hetherill,
C.S.A., and perhaps too had opened it to
new ideas. It had never occurred to me
before that I was such an important personage.</p>

<p>I followed Miss Hetherill to the second
sitting of the military court in the
trial-room, though this time as a witness
and not as the accused.</p>

<p>The colonel was majestic at the head
of the table. He was in a splendid gray
uniform, gay with gold lace, as if he
deemed the occasion worthy of his best
appearance. Crothers had taken the
place of Dr. Ambrose as secretary, and
the doctor himself was at the foot of the
table.</p>

<p>The examination was brief, and to the
colonel very unsatisfactory. I made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
poor witness. I denied that any one had
helped me, and the doctor with equal
emphasis denied complicity. The colonel
frowned at me, but the doctor received
the larger share of his attention,
and I was of the opinion that the colonel
considered him a greater villain than
myself, as I was an enemy by birth,
while the doctor was a household traitor.</p>

<p>"You do not deny making to me the
proposition that we surrender to the Federal
government?" finally said the colonel.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the doctor, firmly.
"That was my suggestion, and I repeat
it. We alone are holding out. What
chance have we ever to carry our cause
through to success?"</p>

<p>Colonel Hetherill looked around at
his men as if he feared the effect of those
words upon them. They were impassive,
though I inferred from what Grace had
said that several were beginning to share
the doctor's way of thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your answer," said the colonel to
Dr. Ambrose, "is sufficient proof of
treasonable designs. The answer itself
I consider treason. I will hear no more."</p>

<p>He promptly dissolved the court, ordered
Dr. Ambrose and myself to be
locked up again, and refused to listen to
anything his daughter wished to say.
What further steps he took I did not
know then, for under escort I passed on
to my room and was out of sight and
hearing.</p>

<p>That evening Grace came to my room
again, and, as before, she was visibly
under the influence of strong emotion.</p>

<p>"You must escape again to-night,"
she said, "and this time you must not be
overtaken. I have arranged everything,
and it will be easy enough for you to
reach the mountains."</p>

<p>"What will become of Dr. Ambrose?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"We will save him, too, though I do
not yet know how," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor had taken his risk partly
on my account, and I did not feel like
abandoning him in danger. I am willing
to admit also that I wanted to see how
events at Fort Defiance would culminate.
So I refused to leave the fort. My refusal
greatly disturbed Grace, and she
begged me to go. Her cheeks were
flushed, her eyes luminous, and she
looked very beautiful.</p>

<p>"Would you have me think of myself
alone?" I asked. "It is true that I
seem to have brought trouble here, but I
can't cure it by slipping away to-night.
I mean to stay."</p>

<p>She had nothing more to say, but one
look she gave me seemed to approve of
my decision. She left the room hastily,
and I did not hear the key turn in the
lock. I tried the door, and found that
it was not locked. Through neglect or
intention, I was free to go about Fort
Defiance, and I inferred that the colonel's
affairs in truth were in a critical state, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
so little attention was paid to me. I
looked out in the hall, but saw no one.
I walked lightly to the top of the stair-case,
but, hearing voices below, concluded
it would be best to return to my
room. From the window I saw that the
drawbridge was up, and I doubted the
chances of escape, even had I wished
it.</p>

<p>I remained there an hour or so, trying
to decide upon the wisest course. Unable
to come to any decision, I went
into the hall again for lack of something
better to do. From the top of the stair-case
I heard voices in loud and excited
conversation. I crept half-way down
the steps. I stopped there to listen further,
and feeling sure that some event
of great importance had happened, I
walked boldly all the way down.</p>

<p>The front door, which looked out
upon the little brass cannon, was wide
open. Grace and Crothers stood near it,
talking in hurried and excited tones. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
half-dozen soldiers were about them, and
occasionally they said something as if by
way of suggestion. They paid no attention
to me until I came so close that
Grace herself could not help noticing
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. West!" she cried. "We
are so glad you are here now!"</p>

<p>Naturally I was full of interest and
curiosity, and asked the cause of the
trouble. Then they told me that Dr.
Ambrose had escaped, by the connivance
of some one, I guessed, and had fled to
the mountains. The colonel, discovering
his escape, had called upon his men
to pursue him, and if necessary shoot
him on sight. They had refused unanimously
to go, and the colonel in his
rage had taken his old army rifle and
had gone alone.</p>

<p>Here in truth was a pretty muddle.
The colonel's state of mind was such
that without doubt he would shoot the
doctor if he found an opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
which would be a double tragedy to all
the people of Fort Defiance.</p>

<p>"The colonel must be pursued and
overtaken," I said.</p>

<p>"At once," said Grace, with an emphasis
that showed I had only seconded
her own argument.</p>

<p>Crothers and all the others looked at
me as if waiting for a suggestion. I
seemed by an easy transition to change
from the prisoner of Fort Defiance to its
chief. Since they looked upon me as
such, that I decided to be.</p>

<p>"What road did the colonel take?"
I asked of Crothers.</p>

<p>"There is only one passable way out
of the mountains," replied Crothers;
"the one you followed. We know that
both the doctor and the colonel took it."</p>

<p>I saw a look of intelligence pass between
him and Grace, and I wondered
no longer at the doctor's escape or his
destination. Our duty and the method
of doing it were plainly before us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>It required but a few minutes for me
to organize our search and rescue expedition.
I made Crothers my lieutenant,
and took all but four men, leaving these
to care for the house. Food enough
for several days and blankets for the
night were collected hastily, and then we
were ready. Miss Hetherill approached
cloaked and hooded. To my protest
she replied with much firmness that she
was going with us.</p>

<p>"But the road over these mountains
is not fit for a lady to travel," I said.</p>

<p>"I have been over that road often,
and I know these mountains much better
than you, Mr. West," she replied.</p>

<p>I could not dispute her assertion, and
moreover her presence would be useful
to us in certain contingencies. She was
a strong, active girl; and I made no further
objection. We left the house; the
drawbridge was lowered to let us pass,
and when we had crossed was raised
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes we were out of the
valley and in the mountains, following
the old road. As it was my second
journey, I saw how easy it was for the
colonel and his men to pursue and overtake
me. It was the only real road
through the mountains, and one followed
it as naturally as the waters of a brook
flow down its channel.</p>

<p>"How long a start of us has the colonel?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Not more than an hour," replied
Crothers; "but he is strong, in spite of
his age, and a good mountaineer. I
guess he can go faster than we can."</p>

<p>It is true that one man, other things
being equal, can travel faster than half a
dozen who stick together, and in it lay
the danger that the colonel would out-foot
us. But there was consolation in
the thought that Dr. Ambrose had the
same advantage.</p>

<p>It was an indifferent night, neither very
clear nor very dark. There was light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
enough to show the peaks and the
ravines, but only to distort them. I let
Crothers, who knew the way, take the
lead, and I dropped back by the side of
Miss Hetherill. We were silent for
some time; then I made a lame apology
for blundering upon Fort Defiance and
bringing such trouble to its inmates.</p>

<p>"It is not your fault that you came,
Mr. West," she said, "and even if you
had come by intention we would have
no right to complain. Something of
the kind was bound to happen some
day."</p>

<p>I was glad that she admitted the
abnormal conditions of Fort Defiance.
That she knew them was obvious, for
she had passed but little of her life there
and knew the swing of the world.</p>

<p>We made speed, despite the roughness
of the way. Some mists or fine clouds
sifted before the moon, and the visible
world became small. But we went on
without uncertainty. The fugitive could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
not well turn from the path, nor could
the pursuer.</p>

<p>I saw Crothers looking up at the
white, silky clouds: once he shook his
head doubtfully, but I did not ask him
his thought. With plenty of company,
the mountains did not impress or awe
me as on the night of my flight. Once
our course dipped into a little valley down
which a brook trickled. In the soft
earth on either side of it the vigilant
Crothers saw footsteps which he said
were those of two men. We knew the
two men must be the doctor and the
colonel.</p>

<p>"I should judge from those footprints,
though I can't tell precisely," said
Crothers, "that we haven't gained anything
on them."</p>

<p>This was somewhat discouraging, and
our enthusiasm did not grow when the
path, after leaving the valley, or rather
slit in the hills, led up a very steep and
long slope. Our muscles relaxed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the strain, and the breath came in irregular
puffs. I was very tired, but I was
not willing to own it, especially as I saw
Grace walking with still vigorous step.
She had told the truth when she said she
was a better mountaineer than I.</p>

<p>The mists thickened. The moon was
but a faint glimmer through them, and
they drifted like lazy clouds. Our world
narrowed again, and instinctively we
walked very close together. It was like
a fog at sea; the damp of it carried a
raw penetrating chill. There was no
wind to moan or sing through the
ravines; the mountains were silent save
for ourselves. Crothers suggested a
light, and produced from under his coat
the torch with which he had provided
himself in view of such emergency. It
was a long stick, soaked in some compound
of tar and turpentine, and when
he lighted one end and held it aloft it
burned with energy, casting a bright,
cheerful light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless we shivered in our
clothes; the chill in the air was insistent,
and the mist was soaking into the
ground and the autumn foliage. All
the world seemed to be a-sweat, and,
poor woodsman as I was, I knew that
this had its perils. Pneumonia is not
picturesque, but it is very dangerous.</p>

<p>Crothers looked at me several times
as if he expected me to make a suggestion,
but, though by common consent
I was the leader of the party, I waited
for him to make it, as he knew more
about mountains and forests than I.
But we plodded on for a long time before
he spoke. Then he announced that
we must stop for a while and build a
fire.</p>

<p>"If we don't," he said, "we'll be
soaked through and through with the
cold mist, and in another hour some of
us will be shaking with the chills and
fever."</p>

<p>Grace protested against stopping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
She was in the greatest alarm lest a
tragedy should happen ahead of us, but,
while we felt the same fear, we recognized
also the truth of the old maxim
about the futility of too much haste.
I pointed out the dangers to her, and
urged that her father probably had
sought shelter somewhere before this.
She was compelled to yield, not to my
arguments necessarily, but to her own
judgment. I often think what a jolly
world this would be if our judgment
and our wishes were always agreed.</p>

<p>We chose a somewhat sheltered spot,
which was not difficult to find in a region
of hill on hill, criss-crossed with ravines
and gullies, and gathered heaps of brushwood.
The fire was much more difficult
to light than on the night when I
was the colonel's prisoner, but we set it
to burning at last, and glad we were
when the flames rose high up in the chilly
darkness.</p>

<p>We refreshed ourselves with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
supper. Then Crothers insisted that
some of us, and especially Miss Hetherill,
should get a little sleep. Again she
showed herself a wise girl by trying to
obey, despite her wishes. We made her
a bed of blankets between the fire and a
cliff, and, though she said she would not
be able to sleep, in half an hour she
slept. As she lay there with a bit of
her pale, weary face showing above the
blankets, I felt very sorry for her, far
sorrier than I had ever felt for myself,
even when under sentence of death; I
could see the reality of her trouble, and
I had never believed fully in mine.</p>

<p>All the men except Crothers and I
and a third rolled themselves in their
blankets and slept. I sat by the fire,
wondering what the outcome of it all
would be. I noticed that Crothers continued
to look up uneasily at the skies
and the clouded moon, and at last I
asked him what he might have on his
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bad weather," he replied, briefly.</p>

<p>"We have that already," I said, pointing
to the cliffs soaking in the wet mist.</p>

<p>"More coming," he said, putting on a
very weatherwise look.</p>

<p>"What do you expect?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe snow, but more likely sleet,
and that, too, before morning," he replied.
"It's early for such things, but
all the signs point that way."</p>

<p>I asked him no more. This was most
unpromising, and gave full warrant for
his grave looks. The mists were lifting,
though very slowly, and were gathering
in clouds above us. The peaks were
ghostly gray, and the moon narrowed to
a half-rim of steel and then disappeared
altogether. The dampness remained in
the air, but the cold was too great for
rain. As Crothers said, either snow or
sleet would come.</p>

<p>I suggested to Crothers that we make
some sort of protection for Miss Hetherill.
We built up little walls of brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on three sides of her and covered them
over with the same material. She slept
so heavily from exhaustion, poor girl,
that she never awakened to our noise,
and when we finished our improvised
hut our satisfaction was all the greater
because we had not disturbed her at
all.</p>

<p>Then we built up the fires and waited
for what might come. I dozed awhile,
and awoke to find that the clouds had
thickened. All the peaks were hidden
by them, and there was some wind, just
enough to make a subdued moan.
Crothers said it lacked about two hours
of day. I noticed that he had put the
men at work again, and they had gathered
brushwood sufficient to make the
camp-fire of a regiment.</p>

<p>"The clouds will do what they are
going to do very soon," said Crothers;
and he was right. Presently we heard a
patter upon the dry leaves like the falling
of dust-shot. Little white kernels re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>bounded
and fell again. One lodged in
my eye, and I winked until I got it
out. The patter increased; the dust-shot
turned to bird-shot.</p>

<p>"Hail," said Crothers. "We're in for
it."</p>

<p>We woke all the men and made shelter
for ourselves as best we could in the
lee of the cliff. Another blanket spread
over the top of Grace's rude bower was
sufficient protection for her. Soon we
had a fine downpour of hail. It was
like a white bombardment, from which
we were safe within our works. I would
have been content to watch it, had it not
put such obstacles in the way of our
pursuit. The ground whitened quickly
under the fall of the hail, and by and by,
when the wind shifted to the south, the
clouds discharged rain instead of hail.
This was no improvement, and in fact
its probable sequel was what we dreaded
most. The shift of the wind came again,
and then happened what often happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in our fickle climate: the rain which
covered everything turned to ice under
the wind from the north, and in an hour
the earth was clad in a complete suit of
white armor.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising above the last
peaks. Every cloud had gone from the
sky, and the day, hidden before by the
wall of mountains, seemed to come all
at once. Every ray of the sun was
caught up by the sheet of white and
gleaming ice and reflected back. Our
eyes were dazzled by the brilliancy of the
morning, for the ice covered everything.
Every leaf, every twig, was encrusted
with it. It was all very beautiful, and
all very dangerous. Mountain-climbing
on sheets of ice is a slippery business.</p>

<p>As usual, I turned to Crothers for
advice.</p>

<p>"We'll have to creep along as best we
can," he said. "But, while we can't go
fast, neither can the doctor nor the colonel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the one redeeming point of
the situation. Whatever affected us affected
both the pursued, and we remained
on an equal footing. We awoke Grace,
who was astonished and dismayed at the
sight of the earth cased in ice. Then
we had a little breakfast, and prepared to
resume our dangerous pursuit.</p>

<p>I had heard of Alpine climbing, and,
though I had never done any of it, the
virtues of an alpenstock were not unknown
to me. We selected slender but
stout sticks from the brushwood, sharpened
the ends, and, having hardened
them in the fire, made our start, each
thus provided. It was treacherous work,
and our falls were many, but we were
satisfied to escape with mere bruises, for
one might easily pitch over a precipice
or tumble down a long, steep-hill
slope and become a mere bag of broken
bones.</p>

<p>The sun shone in splendor, but the
rays were without warmth. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
white, not yellow, and a white light is
always cold. The brilliant reflection
from the ice-fields forced us to keep our
eyes half closed, if we did not want to
be blinded.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />AT THE HUT.</h2></div>


<p>The way was still certain, a rude
path coiling among the hills, from
which the sheets of ice glistening like
new glass, and as treacherous, forbade
us to turn. Sometimes the wind would
blow, and the ice-clad bushes would
rattle together to the tune of castanets.
Our stock of bruises grew with steadiness
and certainty, but we could boast
of progress.</p>

<p>Once the path dipped down between
two peaks of unusual height. The wind
was blowing rather sharply at the time,
and from the white head of the higher
peak on our left came a faint rumble.
Crothers showed alarm and urged us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
greater speed. I half guessed what he
meant, and lent Grace an arm to hurry
forward. The rumble grew to a roar,
and we had just turned the dangerous
defile when the avalanche plunged down
the slope into the path we had left, setting
all the echoes astir and sending up
a cloud of white snow-dust. I am of
opinion that several tons of valuable ice
and packed hail were wasted in that
drift, but as we escaped it all perhaps we
have no right to complain.</p>

<p>We passed the spot at which I had
been retaken, and thence the way was
new to me. But its character did not
change. The untenanted mountains
seemed to roll away to the end of the
world.</p>

<p>"We ought to reach the hut by the
middle of the afternoon," said Crothers.</p>

<p>"What's the hut?" I asked, having
heard nothing before of such a place.
Then Crothers explained that it was a
rude little cabin which the colonel had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
erected beside the path, to be used as a
stopping-place on the way to the outside
world, or as a lodge on hunting expeditions.
He was hopeful that we would
find the colonel or the doctor or both
there. It seemed to me very probable
that we would.</p>

<p>Grace, who had been somewhat down-hearted,
though she never complained,
cheered up at the prospect of the hut,
and in truth all our little army pressed
forward with fresh zest and enthusiasm.
Hope is easily able to pin itself upon
little things. We walked and slid
along at much better speed, and Crothers
even told stories of winter campaigns,
though he was forced to admit that he
had never found skates quite so necessary
as they seemed to be now.</p>

<p>Our path led directly toward a ridge
which seemed to block the way like a
wall.</p>

<p>"Up there on the comb of that ridge
is the hut," said Crothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Though my muscles complained and
my bruises were as numerous as the
spots on a leopard, I was full of ambition
to reach this little lodge of logs,
which seemed to me to be a fit home
for some Robinson Crusoe of the mountains.
Presently Crothers uttered a joyful
grunt,&mdash;he never rose to the dignity
of an exclamation,&mdash;and pointed to a
find blue trail of smoke rising like a
white plume from the slender comb of
the ridge.</p>

<p>"That's from the hut," he said, "and
somebody's there, sure."</p>

<p>His logic seemed sound. The smoke
had a most comfortable, home-like look.
It was a bit of warmth and cheer in the
cold, white wilderness. It encouraged
us so much that we were willing to
wager we would find both the colonel
and the doctor there, good friends again,
and ready to return with us to Fort Defiance.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the column was de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>fined
more clearly against the sky, and
Crothers was positive that it came from
the hut.</p>

<p>"It's built in a little patch of woods
on a level spot of about a quarter of an
acre," he said, "and my eye says the
smoke rises straight from that spot."</p>

<p>By and by, as we climbed the slope,
we could see the hut itself, coated with
ice like the trees. The smoke was
coming from the little mud chimney,
and we guessed that a fine fire was blazing
on the hearth. I, for one, began to
wish that I was sitting in front of that
same fire, listening to the popping of
the dry wood as the flames ate into it.
But Grace outstripped us, in so far as her
cause for anxiety was greater than ours.
She ran forward, pushed open the door
of the hut, and sprang inside. We
heard a cry of disappointment, and, following
her, found the hut was empty,
save for ourselves.</p>

<p>Upon the stone hearth the fine fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that I had pictured to myself was really
blazing. Upon a bench lay some scraps
of bread and meat, but the host, whoever
he might be, was absent.</p>

<p>It was a little place, not more than
seven or eight feet square, with a roof
that the head of a tall man could touch.
Two or three deerskins were on the floor,
some antlers were fastened on the wall,
and besides the bench there were three
rude little stools. It was not exactly a
drawing-room, but it was a warm and
hospitable spot in the wilderness. At
least it seemed so to me. Grace sat
down on one of the stools and leaned
her head against the wall, too brave to
cry, but not strong enough to conceal all
her disappointment. She had been sure
that we would find the colonel in the
hut.</p>

<p>"Since the landlord of the hotel is
away and there is no one to welcome us,
I propose that we welcome ourselves," I
said, wishing to appear cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Crothers silently seconded the motion
by throwing fresh wood on the fire,
drawing up a stool, and warming his
hands. Then we held a brief council of
war. It was obvious that some one had
been at the hut, but whether the colonel
or the doctor there was nothing to indicate.
Whichever it might be, it was
most likely that he would soon return,
and we concluded that it was our best
plan to pass the night there. It was late
in the day, and no one could think of
any other course that promised better.
Crothers and I scouted a bit in the neighborhood,
but we discovered nothing of
the lodge's missing tenant. Whoever
he was, he seemed to have gone on a
long journey from his table and fireside,
and we had little to do but appropriate
his table, sit at his fireside, and wait for
his return.</p>

<p>The end of the day was near, and the
night promised to be very cold. Autumn
might be lingering yet in the low-lands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
but up here in the mountains,
close to the skies, winter was sovereign.
The sun went over the hills, the whiteness
of the earth turned to pallor, and
in the dusk the icy mountains gleamed
cheerless and cold. I was very glad that
necessity bade us stay at the hut.</p>

<p>We bestirred ourselves and gathered
wood, for we intended to keep a good
fire all night. We assigned Grace to
one corner beside the fireplace, and made
a screen for it by hanging up two or
three deerskins. Then we heaped the
wood on the fire until the blaze roared
up the chimney. A little window, a
mere cut in the logs, a half-foot square,
was left open. When I went out I
could see the light of the fire shining
through it, and casting long streaks of
red across the ice, the one friendly beacon
in the dreary wilderness.</p>

<p>As the day waned and the night took
its place, I began to fear that it was
neither the colonel nor the doctor who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
had built the fire, or surely he would
have returned before this. After all, it
might have been some stray hunter or
mountaineer who had lighted the comfortable
blaze, warmed himself, and
passed on, leaving it to serve the same
purpose for any other who might come.</p>

<p>At that point the mountains were
more accessible than farther back toward
Fort Defiance. One might penetrate
them in several directions if he were willing
to risk falls on the sheet ice. Several
of us, taking our alpenstocks, explored
the neighborhood again. The
light was sufficient, the reflection from
the ice throwing a kind of pale glow
over everything. But our explorations
brought no profit, and, the night, as we
had expected, turning very cold, we returned
to the hut.</p>

<p>We stacked our rifles against the wall
and composed ourselves for rest. We
did not realize, until the necessity for
exertion was over, how very tired we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
were. Grace retired to her curtained
corner, and in a few minutes was so still
there that we knew she must be asleep
despite anxiety. Some of the soldiers
stretched themselves upon the floor, and
they, too, soon slept. Another, sitting
upon a stool, with his head against the
wall, snored placidly. We saw no necessity
for keeping watch, and even the
vigilant Crothers lay down upon the
bench, where his eyes soon closed and
his breathing became long and regular.
The last army of the Confederacy was
sound asleep, and the colonel's Yankee
spy alone was awake.</p>

<p>They were old, men mostly, heads
gray, almost white, and faces deeply
seamed, like the colonel's. But they
looked to me like a loyal lot, and my
sympathy went out to these old fellows,
every one of whom I had no doubt carried
old scars on his body. I was sitting
on a stone before the fire, trying to read
my fortune in the deep bed of coals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Tiring of the vain pursuit, I walked to
the little window. The old soldiers slept
such a tired and heavy sleep that my
footsteps did not disturb them.</p>

<p>I could see nothing but the mountains,
cold and white as a tombstone, and hear
nothing but the occasional rattle of the
loose ice as it fell from the trees and shattered
on the thicker ice below.</p>

<p>I went back to the fire, picked out a
convenient place in front of it, and decided
that I too would recognize the
claims of exhaustion and sleep, which
were now growing clamorous. Doubling
up my blanket and putting it under my
head for a pillow, I stretched myself out
with my feet to the fire and resumed my
old occupation of studying the red coals
and the fortune that might be written for
me there. I had done it many a time as
a boy, and as a man I was not changed.</p>

<p>The regular and heavy breathing of the
sleepers had something soothing in it.
The logs burned through, crumbled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
fell in coals, adding to the glowing mass.
With my half-closed eyes making much
from little and seeing things that were
not, I built castles in the fire and sent
troops of real soldiers marching through
them. When the fourth castle was but
half finished, I closed my eyes and joined
the others in sleep.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the strangeness of these
scenes, much more strange to me than to
the others, that disturbed and excited my
brain while I slept, and by and by made
me waken. The great heap of coals had
sunk but little lower, and I reckoned that
I had not slept more than two hours at
the farthest. It was very warm in the
room, for we had not been chary with
the fire, and I turned to the little window
for fresh air.</p>

<p>Framed in the window I saw very distinctly
a pair of bright eyes and a part
of a human face. The eyes gazed at
me, and I am quite sure I returned the
stare with equal intentness. We had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hoped for a visitor, but we did not expect
to find him at the window.</p>

<p>I rose quickly to my feet, and the face
was withdrawn. Wishing to look into
the matter myself without disturbing the
others, I walked lightly to the door, on
the way stepping over the prostrate bodies
of two or three members of the Confederate
army. I opened the door and went
out. When I came to the window I
found that my man was gone, but not
fifty feet away, walking toward the recesses
of the mountains, was a tall, slender
figure. I knew that military bearing
could belong to none other in those
mountains than Colonel Hetherill, and I
felt sure also that it was he who had been
looking through the window at us.</p>

<p>I ran after him, but he was better accustomed
to sleety mountains than I, and
the distance between us widened. He
curved around a hillock, and for a few
moments was out of my sight, but when
I too passed the hillock I saw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
straight ahead, his shoulders stooped a
little, but walking swiftly as if he were
bent upon reaching the very heart of the
highest and most difficult mountains.</p>

<p>I shouted to him to stop, and I knew
he must have heard me, but for some
time he paid no attention. At last he
turned around and faced me.</p>

<p>"Why do you go away, colonel?" I
asked. "I am no enemy of yours. I
am your friend. We have come to
rescue you from the wilderness. Your
daughter is back there in the hut."</p>

<p>"You are an infernal Yankee spy,"
he said, "and you are worse than that;
you have turned my people against
me."</p>

<p>"Colonel," I said, protesting, "don't
delude yourself that way any longer.
The war is over."</p>

<p>"It is not," he said. "All my men
may surrender, but I at least will hold
out. Don't I know that they have given
up? I saw them in the hut with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and you were not a prisoner. Keep off,
I tell you; do not come near me."</p>

<p>I was advancing toward him, not
with any intent to harm him, instead
the precise reverse, and he, seeing that I
would not stop, whipped a pistol out of
his belt and fired at me. I suppose his
hand was chilled by the cold, for the
bullet flew wide of me, chipping splinters
from the icy side of a hill. But I
stopped, out of regard for my life, expecting
another pistol, and he turned and
continued his course into the higher
mountains. I shouted to him to stop,
and I shouted to my comrades in the
hut, but the one would not and the
others could not hear. He never looked
back, and at last disappeared in a thicket,
every bush of which in the moonlight
looked as if it were cast in silver.</p>

<p>I walked back toward the hut, feeling
some chagrin over my failure to keep
one of the men for whom we had been
looking, after I had found him. I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
say with truth that I was not angered
at the colonel's bullet, as I thought
I understood him. The light of the
fire was still shining through the little
window, or rather hole in the wall, and
threw a long red bar of light across
the whitened earth. It was a friendly
beacon to any man in a normal state of
mind.</p>

<p>All the people in the hut were still
sound asleep, the snore of some of the
veterans placidly riding the night wind.
I took Crothers gently by the shoulders,
and succeeded in waking him without
waking any of the others. Then I led
him out of the hut and told him my
story. He agreed with me that it was
best not to say anything to Grace of the
incident. But he was in a quandary
about the wisest course for us to pursue
in the morning, as the possible paths now
led in several directions.</p>

<p>This quandary was ended for the time
by the sound of a rifle-shot. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
so far from expecting anything of the
kind that it startled us both very much.
My fear, and I believe that of Crothers
was the same, was lest the colonel and
the doctor had met. We knew that the
colonel had taken a rifle with him when
he left Fort Defiance, and probably he
had put it in some convenient place
near by when he came down to spy us
out in the hut.</p>

<p>"Take this pistol," said Crothers,
shoving one into my hand, "but, remember,
Colonel Hetherill must not be
harmed."</p>

<p>The people in the hut seemed to be
sleeping on calmly, and, leaving them to
their rest, we ran as fast as we could in
the direction from which the shot had
come. Though we had heard the report
distinctly, owing to the rarefied mountain
air, I judged that the gun had been fired
at least a mile away. There were many
echoes, and it was somewhat difficult for
us to distinguish the true sound from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
false, but we agreed upon a general
northeast course.</p>

<p>When we had gone half a mile the gun
was fired again, the report echoing as gallantly
in the still night as if it had been a
little cannon instead of an ordinary rifle.</p>

<p>"Up the valley there!" cried Crothers.
"Follow that, and it will be sure to take
us right."</p>

<p>I disagreed with him, however. The report
seemed to me to have been farther
to the left, and I insisted upon my opinion.</p>

<p>"All right," said Crothers; "you go
that way, and I will go up the gully;
one or the other of us will be likely to
strike it right."</p>

<p>He ran up the gully, and, obedient to
his suggestion, I bent away to the left.
But I found myself in a very slippery
country, the mountains breaking there
into successive little ridges like the waves
of the sea, though the general direction
was upward. Luckily there was a good
growth of bushes, and more than once I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
kept myself from falling by grasping at the
outstretched boughs. When I had nearly
reached the spot from which I thought
the shot had come, I saw a man standing
near a tree. The next instant he saw
me and sprang behind the tree. I caught
but a glimpse of the slender figure and
gray hair, but it was enough for me. I
had found the colonel again, and I did
not mean for him to try a second shot
at me which might be better aimed than
the first.</p>

<p>I sprang behind some rocks, where I
was adequately sheltered so long as he
remained in his present position. I feared
that he would try to get a shot at me,
thinking I was trying to do him harm, and
I shifted my position a little, moving farther
on behind the wall of rock. I had
no intention of firing at him, for several
reasons; and I recognized that it was a
very difficult task for me to take an armed
man against whom I had no intention
of using arms. But I believed that if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
could slip upon him unawares I could
overpower him with superior force and
strength, and disarm him.</p>

<p>Ledges of rock were plentiful there,
the mountain being broken into an infinite
succession of ridges and ravines.
Once I slipped on the sleet and crashed
into a thicket which stopped me. But
the ice knocked off the boughs fell with
a rattle like hail, and I was in a tremor
lest the colonel should fire at me from
some point of vantage before I could regain
my feet. But the shot did not
come, and, righting myself, I went on,
wishing that my shoes were shod with
sharp nails and plenty of them.</p>

<p>The ground seemed favorable for my
design. The gully up which I was
creeping curved around behind the tree
that sheltered Colonel Hetherill, and I
believed that with caution I could suddenly
throw myself upon him from the
rear and overwhelm him. I dropped
down on my hands and knees, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
though my progress was slow, I avoided
another fall. The colonel gave no sign.
I presumed that he was behind the tree,
watching for an attack and seeking an
opening in his turn.</p>

<p>I rose up a little, trying to peep over
the wall of the gully toward the tree,
and caught a glimpse of a gray head
lifted above the same gully wall, but just
around the curve. He dropped back
like a flash, and from prudential motives
I did the same. The curve of the gully
at that point was sharp. In fact, it was
more of an angle than a curve, and he
was only a yard or two from me. As I
hugged the wall, I could hear his heavy,
tired breathing. I thought once of turning
about and going back, but I concluded
that it would never do. The
colonel had escaped me once, and I
would be ashamed to confess to my comrades
that he had escaped me twice. I
resumed my continuous creep, stealing
forward inch by inch until I came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that point in the curve beyond which I
could not pass without coming into his
sight. Then I gathered myself for a
great effort, sprang to my feet, and
darted around the curve, ready to spring
upon him and surprise him.</p>

<p>I encountered another large and living
body rushing in my direction, and the
encounter was so violent that I fell back
on the ice and sleet, half stunned.</p>

<p>In a few moments I recovered and sat
up.</p>

<p>Dr. Ambrose was sitting on a stone
and looking at me, his eyes full of reproach.
He pointed to a purple contusion
on his forehead.</p>

<p>"You did that," he said.</p>

<p>I felt of a growing lump over my left
ear.</p>

<p>"You did that," I said.</p>

<p>He surveyed me, still with reproach.</p>

<p>"I took you for Colonel Hetherill,"
he said.</p>

<p>I put some reproach into my own gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I took you for Colonel Hetherill,
too," I said.</p>

<p>"I expected to take Colonel Hetherill
to the hut," he said, mournfully.</p>

<p>"I expected to do the same," I said,
sadly.</p>

<p>"Since I can't take the colonel to the
hut," he said, "I will take you."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," I said. "While
you are taking me there, I will take you
too. Shake hands, doctor. I'm tremendously
glad to see you, you old rebel."</p>

<p>We shook hands with the greatest
good will. Then he went to the tree
and recovered the rifle which was leaning
behind it, taken by him in his flight.
We started back to the hut, and on the
way he gave an account of himself. He
had fled from Fort Defiance without any
clear object in view except to escape the
colonel's wrath, which he believed would
be but temporary. When the sleet storm
came on he had endured it for a while.
At last he reached the hut, built a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fire, warmed himself thoroughly, and then
went out to look for the colonel, thinking
that the fierceness of the weather
would have chilled his rage by this time.</p>

<p>Seeing nothing of him, he had fired
his rifle twice, in the hope of attracting
his attention, and was returning to the
hut, when he caught a glimpse of me
and believed by my actions that I was
Colonel Hetherill, and moreover that I
was Colonel Hetherill still inflamed
against him. Then he had hidden behind
the tree, hoping just what I had
hoped, and trying to do it.</p>

<p>"If it had been the colonel and he
had got the first chance and fired at you,
what would you have done, doctor?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Colonel Hetherill saved my life
twice, once at Stone River, and once at
Chickamauga," he replied; and I could
get no more direct answer out him.</p>

<p>The doctor looked as if he had been
having a hard time; there was no coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>terfeit
about his joy at seeing me. His
face was haggard, and scales of ice were
on his clothing. I told him about my
meeting with the colonel earlier in the
evening, and it seemed to take some of
the hope out of him.</p>

<p>"The colonel has one idea fixed in
his head," he said, "and I do not think
anything can drive it out."</p>

<p>I raised my voice and shouted for
Crothers, and in a few moments his answering
cry came. His meeting with
the doctor was, as that of two veterans
should be, joyful, but repressed.</p>

<p>We went back to the hut, where we
found the army still asleep. But we
awoke two of the men, directing them
to watch until daylight, while we three
lay down upon the floor and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>Grace's pleasure when she saw the
doctor in the morning sound and well
was great, though she said but little. I
knew the relief it was to her. But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
began at once to organize the search for
the last rebel. The hut was to remain
a base of operations for the present, and,
despite her protests, we insisted that
Grace remain there at least that day. I
had some hope that the colonel, pressed
by cold and hunger, might return to the
hut; but the doctor shattered this hope
by saying that he might find shelter and
food elsewhere in the mountains.</p>

<p>"He was fond of hunting," said the
doctor, "and it is more than likely that
in such a wilderness he provided one or
more little camps besides this for future
use."</p>

<p>We divided into two parties. Crothers
led one, and the doctor the other. I
went with the doctor. I waved my
handkerchief as a sign of good cheer to
Grace, who stood in the doorway, and
we were soon in the mazes of the higher
mountains. A good sun came out, and
in an hour the weather had turned warm
enough to permit snow, but not warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
enough to melt the ice and sleet. The
clouds soon gathered, obscuring the sun,
and for an hour we had a gentle snow
which covered the ground a quarter of
an inch deep, but did not trouble us, as
the morning was without wind. It made
our footing much less uncertain, and the
doctor drew further encouragement from
it, as we might find the colonel's footsteps
if he should move about after the
snow-fall.</p>

<p>The doctor hoped no more than what
proved to be the truth, for as the noon
hour approached, one of the men called
attention to footsteps in the snow. We
believed they could be no other than the
colonel's, and we followed the trail, which
led along the hill-side over rocks and
through scrub. It was difficult to follow,
and we might well have credited it
to a younger man, had not the doctor
assured us that the colonel was a most
agile mountaineer.</p>

<p>The trail left the hill-side shortly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
entered a fairly level bit of country,
which by a stretch of courtesy one
might have called a small plateau.
Many scrub bushes grew upon it, but
we could follow the footsteps, whether
they led through the thickets or the open.
The doctor confessed that the region was
new to him, but from the direct manner
in which the trail led on he did not believe
it was strange to Colonel Hetherill.</p>

<p>The plateau by and by dipped down
into a valley, which in its turn gave way
to a lot of knife-edged hills, thick-set
with sharp and pointed stones, but after
this we had the plateau again, and the
trail was there still before us, though it
seemed to lead straight toward a white
peak, too steep for ascent.</p>

<p>The peak was fringed with woods at
the base. As we approached these
woods with our heads down, our eyes
fixed upon the trail of footsteps in the
snow, we were hailed in a loud voice and
ordered to stop. We saw a little shack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
built against the trunk of one of the big
trees. It was thatched over with bark;
under the pent the muzzle of a rifle was
poked out at us in the most alarming
way.</p>

<p>All of us had recognized the voice as
that of Colonel Hetherill, and we believed
the rifle-barrel to be an asset of the same
man.</p>

<p>The doctor answered the hail with the
loud announcement that we were friends,
but the colonel bade us be off at once or
he would shoot. Knowing his temper,
we shifted our ground with great promptness.
But we did not leave. Instead, we
took refuge in the woods and undertook
to prepare a plan of campaign.</p>

<p>The shack was an exceedingly small
affair, but from the roof we saw a piece
of old stove-pipe projecting, and we
guessed that he was provided against
the cold. How he stood in the matter
of food and water we could not know.
But we decided to treat with him at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
thinking we could appeal to his better
reason. The doctor hoisted my white
handkerchief on the end of a stick and
approached the hut. But the colonel
threatened us again with the rifle, and
was all the more furious because the
bearer of the flag was the doctor, who
had assisted in my escape and therefore
was the worst traitor in Fort Defiance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<h2 id="VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />BESIEGERS AND BESIEGED.</h2></div>


<p>The doctor compelled to return, I took
the flag and advanced with it. But
the colonel hated a Yankee spy as much
as a traitor, and warned me off in short
order. We gave the flag to one of the
soldiers, whom the colonel allowed to
approach a little closer. They held a
brief dialogue, and then our messenger
came back to us, announcing that the
colonel regarded all his men as traitors
or deserters and would parley no further
with them. They might besiege him if
they would, but he meant to make a last
stand for the Confederacy.</p>

<p>"Was he well?" I asked the man.</p>

<p>"I didn't see him at all," he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
"for he talked through a chink in the
wall, but his voice was mighty high and
had a crack in it."</p>

<p>This confirmed me in my belief that
privation and excitement had mastered
the colonel. Nevertheless we must sit
down to a siege of the last rebel. We
arranged our forces in such manner that
he could not leave the hut and escape
unseen into the further mountains. We
waited an hour; then, as the colonel in
his castle made no sign, I and a soldier
went back for Grace. We found her in
the hut, waiting impatiently to hear from
us, and she did not show much surprise
when I told her that her father had fortified
himself against us.</p>

<p>She came at once with us, and we
sent her to the colonel's castle. She returned
in a quarter of an hour much
cast down, and told us he was in a fever,
with wild eyes and flushed face. He
refused to come out, and nothing she
said could move him. He even spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
harsh words to her, saying she had joined
his enemies. We sent her back with a
couple of blankets and some provisions,
and then she returned to us again. The
colonel would allow no second person in
his defensive works.</p>

<p>It looked like a long siege, and we
prepared for it. We soon found Crothers
and his party, and we built another
shack in the woods, bringing from it the
furs and other useful articles in the hut.
It was well that we did the work quickly,
for Grace fell quite ill with hardships and
excitement, and soon was in a fever and
talking a bit wildly.</p>

<p>We put her in the shack on a bed of
furs, and Dr. Ambrose, who did not have
the title of doctor in vain, attended her,
and said she would be all right in a day
or so. But her illness was a misfortune,
for she was the only one who could be
considered a strict neutral and could
carry messages between our little army
and the colonel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>We were sufficient in number to form
a picket around Fort Hetherill, for so I
named the colonel's shack, but we were
very careful not to come within range of
its defender's rifle. One of the men, a
good fellow named Kimball, went a little
closer than the rest of us, and the
prompt discharge of the rifle from Fort
Hetherill showed that the colonel was
watching. The bullet skipped across
the ice fifty feet short of its mark. Kimball
moved farther away.</p>

<p>Having posted the men, I made a
round and cautioned each to watch
faithfully. But the caution was scarcely
necessary. Every man there was under
heavy obligations to the colonel for
something or other, and all meant to
take him alive.</p>

<p>It was cold work there on the ice, but
we had brought provisions with us, and
that supply, coupled with what was
stored in the hut, prepared us amply for
a siege in form. We made some coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and served it to the men on picket duty,
following it up a little later with a nip
of whiskey for each, and they felt quite
warm and comfortable. The colonel,
after his rifle-shot, rested on his arms and
maybe looked to his defences. The
piece of old stove-pipe which projected
through the roof began to smoke, showing
that he had firewood and that he too
was able to keep warm. It looked like
a long siege.</p>

<p>The general commanding, who was
myself, and Crothers, the second in command,
held a council of war and decided
to postpone operations until nightfall,
when Crothers thought he would be
able under cover of the darkness to steal
upon the colonel and take him. Then
we waited for the slow afternoon to limp
away. The sun was of a dazzling
brightness, but there was no warmth in
it. The ice-fields glittered under the
rays, but did not melt. The light was
reflected, and with half-shut eyes we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
watched the peaks and the coated trees.
Sometimes faint blue, purple, and green
tints showed through the white glare.</p>

<p>"Crothers," said I, "if ever I go on
another winter campaign like this, I will
not forget a pair of green goggles, largest
size."</p>

<p>"I wish I had them now," said
Crothers.</p>

<p>The glow on the ice-fields turned to
gold as the sun began to set behind the
highest peak, from gold shifted to a
blood-red, and as the sun went out of
sight faded and left the pale green of a
wan twilight.</p>

<p>"These sheets of ice are in our way
in more ways than one," said Crothers.
"They light up the night so much that
I could put a bullet in a silver quarter at
twenty paces."</p>

<p>"Do you think the colonel could do
as well?" I asked, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>We thought it well to wait until past
midnight, when the night would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
darkest. So we served supper and hot
coffee, relieved the pickets, and waited.
The colonel in his fortress seemed to be
content: at least he gave no sign. Dr.
Ambrose reported that Miss Hetherill
was much better and would be on her
feet again in the morning. The night
limped as painfully as the day, and had
the added demerit of being colder.</p>

<p>A wind came down from the northeast,
and there was a raw sharp edge to
it. I shivered and my bones creaked
with cold inside the heavy overcoat
Crothers had given me. May the good
Lord deliver me from any more winter
campaigns! The moon, pale and icy,
rose, and its chilly rays were reflected
from the more chilly ice. Pieces of ice
blown from the crusted boughs rattled
dryly as they fell.</p>

<p>As Crothers had foretold, the white
glare of the earth lighted up the night
until objects were almost as distinct as by
daylight. The outlines of Fort Hether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>ill
were clear. I could even trace the
ridges in the bark. Any of us advancing
would make a most beautiful target, and
we stuck to our determination to wait
for further darkness.</p>

<p>The column of smoke from the colonel's
hut increased, as if he too felt the
growing cold and would ward it off.
Midnight came, and shortly afterward
the heavens began to darken. The outlines
of Fort Hetherill grew dimmer. I
could no longer trace the ridges in the
bark; then the hut itself became an indistinct
mass, seeming to wave in the
wind, which still came down from the
mountain-tops and presented bayonet-points
to us. The time seemed favorable
for an advance upon the enemy's
fortifications. Our plan was very simple;
we formed a circle around the hut, intending
to contract this circle until we
reached the house itself, when we would
rush in and seize the garrison. The
difficult part of it was to steal up so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
silently that the garrison would not hear
us coming: to do it we would be compelled
to creep along, taking advantage
of every elevation that would shelter us.</p>

<p>Crothers and I started from adjacent
points in the little wood, and set out
upon our hazardous advance. The
ground was broken and rough, and I
soon lost sight of him, but, despite his
efforts to be noiseless, I could hear his
heavy-soled boots scraping over the ice,
and his breath puffy like that of a man
who was working hard. I dare say I
was interrupting the atmosphere in a
similar manner; but then I was criticising
Crothers, not myself.</p>

<p>I got along pretty well, and was half-way
to Fort Hetherill. I ceased to hear
Crothers for two or three minutes, and
then I heard him scraping along and
puffing as before. As we had come
half the distance without trouble or resistance,
I thought I would go over to
him and hold another conference. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
seemed to me that we needed at least
one more council of war before attacking
the hut, if we were to follow
strictly the mode of procedure prescribed
in the military manuals.</p>

<p>Turning about, I crept and slid toward
him until a little ridge not more
than half a foot high divided us. I
could see his figure stretched out on the
ice, and I reached out to touch him.
But I was anticipated, for he reached up
and grasped me by the throat with two
very strong hands. Then I saw that instead
of stalking Colonel Hetherill, he
had stalked me, the stalker was stalked,
and I recognized in it a fact as painful as
it was alarming.</p>

<p>The colonel seemed to me to be prodigiously
strong for the sick man the
soldier had reported him to be. His
hands compressed my throat so tightly
that I could not cry out, and my limbs
were paralyzed; an unpleasant situation
for an invading army, I willingly admit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
The colonel's eyes were angry, and his
face was very red, which could be the
result both of fever and of wrath. Both,
I think, added to the strength of his
arms.</p>

<p>He sat up on the ice and held me out
at arm's length like a big doll. I knew
that Crothers was near, and I wanted to
cry out instantly and wanted to do it
very badly; but for the life of me I
could not, with that old Confederate's
iron fingers on my throat. I had no
doubt that Crothers and the men would
continue to creep upon the hut, rush
into it, and find nobody there. Meanwhile,
I would be turning into a cold
corpse on the ice.</p>

<p>The colonel released his hold upon my
throat so suddenly that I fell upon my
back and gasped, which, however, was
much better than not breathing at all.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" I asked,
feeling injured in the spirit as well as in
the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was my intention to kill you," he
said, "but I've changed my mind."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" I exclaimed, devoutly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it; it was too easy,"
he said.</p>

<p>If that was the reason, I was not so
thankful. But I considered it good
policy not to explain my views just
then. Although the colonel had released
me, he kept his hand on the butt of a
very large pistol in his belt. I thought
it wise to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, colonel," I said, giving
the military salute as well as I could in
my undignified position.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," he said. "This is a
sortie of mine, understand, and if I have
chosen to spare your life, it is for reasons
of my own. I am going back into my
house, and you would better notify your
friends that I am awake and on guard.
It may save them much hard work and
a little loss of blood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>He slipped back over the ice toward
the fort with an agility marvellous in an
old and ill man. Despite his calm manner,
I had no doubt that fever was still
in his veins. Being so nervous and excitable
when well, it was natural that he
should be calm when ill, especially in
certain stages.</p>

<p>I could see him for at least twenty
feet, and then he disappeared in the
darkness that now clothed the hut like a
mask on a man's face. I felt no doubt
that he was inside, ready to shoot down
the first man who attempted to enter
after him.</p>

<p>In this emergency I thought it best to
find Crothers, notify him that the attack
had failed, and withdraw our forces. I
believe a prudent general always withdraws
when things go wrong. Moreover,
I was getting very cold. Embracing
the earth when it has an inch
coat of ice on its bosom is no such delightful
proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting my ear to the ice, I heard
the scraping of Crothers's hobnails not
fifteen feet away. I was sure that I was
making no mistake this time, and I
speedily overhauled him, to find that it
was the real Crothers. He coincided
with my view that it would be better to
withdraw, like the King of France of
the ancient rhyme, and try again. He
gave a whistle which may have been a
part of the Confederate set of signals,
though I don't know, and in a few minutes
our entire army had retreated and
reassembled at our own hut, casualties
none, and the enemy still in possession
of his defences.</p>

<p>As we had satisfactory proof that the
colonel was vigilant, we decided to end
the military operations for that night and
devote what was left of it to keeping
warm. The hut was occupied by Miss
Hetherill, whom the doctor reported to
be in a sound slumber and doing well.
As all the space under shelter was neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>sarily
reserved for the lady, we decided
to build a big fire near the hut and sit
around it until morning. It was a hard
task, owing to the icy condition of the
firewood, but we got it to going at
last, and the cheerful, crackling blaze
put heart in us all. We had no fear
that the colonel would come out and
shoot at us in the light. He was not
that kind of a soldier, and, besides, his
plan, as far as we could divine it, was to
escape from us, not to inflict any special
injury upon us.</p>

<p>Dr. Ambrose was somewhat cast down
at our failure to seize the colonel at the
first attempt, but his spirits were revived
presently, and when I asked him to tell
me about some of the old battles in
which he and the colonel and the others
present except myself had fought, he
became animated and time ceased to
limp.</p>

<p>An hour of this, and the doctor broke
off abruptly. As Crothers and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
been in the thick of the campaign all
the time, he suggested that we roll ourselves
in our blankets and try to get a
little sleep by the fire. We followed his
advice, and in five minutes I was dead
to the world and its vanities. But presently
I was dragged back out of infinite
depths and told to sit up and open my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, I have just closed them, and
it was at your suggestion," I said to
Crothers.</p>

<p>"You've been asleep for the last three
hours. Wake up and look at the
weather."</p>

<p>I thought the weather a trifling pretext
to awake a man from such pleasant
slumbers, but when I looked about I saw
better. The air had turned much warmer.
There was a smack of wet in it, which
to an experienced man was certain proof
of snow to come, and more of it, too,
than the thin skim of the day before.
Even in the skies, naturally dark from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the night, we could see heavy masses of
clouds rolling.</p>

<p>"It will begin inside of a half-hour,"
said Dr. Ambrose.</p>

<p>"And a snow-storm in the mountains
is no light matter, doctor," I
said.</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>A deep snow would be sure to put a
great check upon our military operations;
it might even make our own
situation precarious, for one must have
food and keep warm. We bestirred
ourselves with the utmost vigor, gathering
firewood, and soon had a huge heap
of it beside the hut. But the snow came
inside the doctor's predicted half-hour,
and with ten minutes to spare. The
clouds opened, and it just dropped down.
The skim of ice was soon covered, which
was an advantage, saving us some falls
and bruises, but it impeded the work on
our new house. It was perfectly obvious
to us all that we must have shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
from such a snow-fall. We were trying
to make a sort of rude shed with sticks
and brushwood in the lee of a cliff. My
comrades were old hands at the business,
and it was marvellous how expert they
were: with some sticks and brushwood,
two or three blankets to help out on the
roof, and even the snow itself, which they
banked up in ridges at the sides, they
made a comfortable place.</p>

<p>I was busy on this rude structure and
trying to keep the snow out of my eyes,
when some one tapped me on the shoulder
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are a promising architect, Mr.
West."</p>

<p>I looked around in the greatest surprise,
and beheld Grace Hetherill, pale,
but otherwise showing no traces of illness.
The heavy dark cloak which she wore
when we started was buttoned high up
around her throat, and a neat dark fur
cap enclosed her hair. She looked very
handsome and picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Miss Hetherill,
on your speedy recovery," I said.</p>

<p>"It was merely nervousness and excitement,"
she replied. "A draught of
something very bitter that Dr. Ambrose
gave me, and a good sleep, have restored
me."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, thinking to cheer
her up: "then there is no reason why
you should not help in the making of
the camp, and show that you are a better
architect than I am."</p>

<p>"I am mountain-bred in part at least,"
she said, "and I know hardships. What
may I do?"</p>

<p>"Take hold of the end of that pole,"
I said, "and lift."</p>

<p>She seized it and with strong young
muscles lifted it up. I was at the other
end, and together we swung it into
place.</p>

<p>"That does pretty well for a rebel lass,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Here, you are the rebel," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
"for this is our territory and you are our
prisoner."</p>

<p>"What's this? what's this?" cried
Dr. Ambrose. His back had been
turned toward us, and he had not seen
the approach of Miss Hetherill. "Just
up from a fever and out here in the
snow! Go back in the hut."</p>

<p>There was sound sense in his command,
and I added my advice to it, but
she would not go until we assured her
that Colonel Hetherill was safe in his
own hut and pointed to the curl of
smoke which still came from his stovepipe.</p>

<p>On second thought we took our own
little hut and moved it bodily to the
shed, deeming it best that all our forces
should keep as close together as possible.
Then, our main task finished, we took
breakfast, and watched the snow, casting
an occasional glance toward Fort Hetherill.
We were glad on the whole now that
the snow had come, for if we should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
snowed up the colonel would be treated
likewise, and perhaps it would induce
him to hoist the white flag.</p>

<p>The day had come, but it was a very
dark and dreary pattern of a day. I
have seen some people who imagine that
Kentucky has a warm climate. It may
have in summer, and so, for the matter
of that, has Manitoba, but for real deep
snows or piercing cold that goes right
through your bones and comes out on
the other side, I will match the Kentucky
mountains against anything this side of
the Arctic circle.</p>

<p>The snow that morning seemed bent
upon making a record. Some of the
flakes looked like big white goose feathers.
Nor was there any nonsense about
them. They came straight down and
took their appointed place on the earth;
others immediately fell and covered them
up, and in turn were served the same
way. There was no wind at all. The
clouds were drawn like a huge dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
blanket across the sky, and gave to
everything except the snow itself a
muddy, grayish-brown tint. Presently
we heard a sharp report in the adjacent
forest, and then another, followed speedily
by another and many others, until they
blended often together like a rolling rifle-fire.
A dreaming veteran might have
thought he was back in the wars, but
none of us stirred, for each knew that it
was the boughs of the trees breaking with
a snap under the weight of new snow.</p>

<p>"That might scare a man who was
never in the woods in big-snow time,"
said Crothers, who had lighted a pipe
and was taking things calmly.</p>

<p>The snow deepened faster than I had
ever seen it before. I could mark it by
the way the surface lines crept up the
side of our rude shed. A few hours of
such industrious clouds and the mountains
would be past travelling. The
skies made promise of nothing else.
There was no break in the dun expanse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The defiant curl of smoke from the
colonel's little fort still rose. I devoutly
hoped that he would remember soon to
come out and join us. Then we could
go back together to Fort Defiance, and
make merry behind stout walls that cared
nothing for snow and cold. But his hut
remained tightly closed, and the snow
was deepening as fast as ever.</p>

<p>Since the colonel would make no
sign, it became evident to me that we
must. I called again my council of
officers, the doctor and Crothers.</p>

<p>"There is nothing for us to do," I
said, "but send Miss Hetherill to the
hut and see if she cannot persuade her
father to join us."</p>

<p>"He has said that he would not admit
her a second time," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"She must push her way in," I said.
"The door to that hut is not strong, and
a father would not fire upon his own
daughter."</p>

<p>They agreed that my plan was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
only thing feasible, and we called Miss
Hetherill. She was eager to undertake
the mission. She had been waiting to
propose it, but held back, expecting us
to act first.</p>

<p>She started at once toward the hut,
which was only two or three hundred
yards away, but her progress was slow.
The snow, which had now attained a
great depth, blocked the way. We
watched her breaking her path through
it toward the hut, where the colonel was
silent and invisible. The little building
seemed almost crushed under its weight
of snow, but the languid coil of smoke
still curled from the mouth of the pipe.
Miss Hetherill was within twenty feet
of the door.</p>

<p>"The colonel hasn't taken notice yet,"
said the doctor. "It would be funny if
she should find him sound asleep and in
our power for hours, if we had only
thought to take him."</p>

<p>I watched with eager interest as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
twenty feet between Miss Hetherill and
the door diminished. She reached the
door and knocked. As she stood there
and waited, I guessed that she received
no answer. She knocked a second time,
waited a minute or so, and then pushed
the door open and entered. She ran out
again in a moment, uttering a cry and
turning a dismayed face toward us.</p>

<p>We ran to the hut as fast as we could,
plunging through the snow. I was the
first to arrive: when I thrust my head
in at the open door, I saw that the place
was empty. Some coals still smoldered
upon the flat stone which served
for a rude fireplace; a dressed deer-skin
lay in the corner; but the colonel was
gone beyond a doubt. One large man
would nearly fill the place.</p>

<p>"He's taken his rifle and ammunition
with him," said Crothers, "so he's all
right."</p>

<p>I was glad that he had called attention
to the fact so promptly, for it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
indicate deliberation and not delirium on
the colonel's part.</p>

<p>There was no need to ask what next
from the men about me. Their obligations
to the colonel would never permit
them to abandon the search for him as
long as one hope that he was alive existed.
But the great snow was a formidable obstacle
to any expedition.</p>

<p>"How shall we go about it?" I asked,
hopelessly, of Dr. Ambrose.</p>

<p>"There is no trail," he replied; "the
falling snow covers up his footsteps a
half-minute after he makes them; but
he must have gone up that slash through
the hills there. It is the easiest route
from here, and the one a man with no fixed
idea in his head would most likely take."</p>

<p>There was a general agreement with
the doctor's opinion, and we planned our
pursuit at once. Four men would remain
at the camp and protect it, and relieve
us should we return exhausted and
without the fugitive. Miss Hetherill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
would remain with them. She made
some demur, saying she was a good
mountaineer and citing proof, but she
yielded to the obvious fact that a woman
could make but little progress through
the deep snow.</p>

<p>"We will be sure to bring him back,"
I said to her when we started.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself too," she said.</p>

<p>"For my sake only?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For all our sakes," she replied.</p>

<p>But she blushed a little, despite the
anxiety which was foremost in her mind.</p>

<p>We passed up the defile, and then our
party spread out like a fan. I was convinced
that the colonel could not have
gone far. The snow was an added obstacle
to the naturally difficult character
of the mountains. It was still pouring
down, half blinding us, and compelling us
to scrutinize every inch of the way lest the
loosening drifts should carry us in an avalanche
to the bottom of some precipice,
which would be highly disagreeable.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />THE RESULTS OF A SNOW-SLIDE.</h2></div>


<p>Dr. Ambrose and I stuck together,
picking our way through the
storm. Snow-covered mountains under
an angry sky are not a cheerful prospect,
and the work was fearfully tiresome.
Down my boot would crush under my
weight through a foot of snow, and to
lift it out again was like drawing a wedge
from a log.</p>

<p>It was winter, but I grew hot, and my
brow produced sweat. My breath
shortened, and my muscles said they
were tired. The doctor noticed me.</p>

<p>"You'd better go back, Mr. West,"
he said. "This is very exhausting business
for one who is not used to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>But I was a bit ashamed of playing
out so soon, and insisted upon going on.
He said nothing then, but when he
raised the question a half-hour later I
was forced to confess that he was right.
A tuckered-out man was of no use on
such a trail.</p>

<p>"You'd better go straight back to the
camp, and I've no doubt you'll find one
or two there who played out before you
did," he said.</p>

<p>Leaving him regretfully, I faced about
and began to plough my way through
the snow on the return journey. I had
noted the landmarks well, and recognized
them easily. The snow, still falling,
had buried all trace of our footsteps
under two or three inches of white. I
tugged along with a fair degree of patience,
wishing at the same time that I
was back at the camp, drying my boots
and drinking a hot toddy,&mdash;unpicturesque
but pleasant occupations. But walking
beat wishing, and at last I saw the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of our camp-fire over a hill. I increased
my speed, trying to make a run through
the deep snow. I passed near the edge
of a cliff, but no nearer than we had
gone when we started on the search. I
forgot that the snow had grown deeper
and more weight was pressing down
upon the slopes. When I was nearest
the edge the snow seemed to slip from
under my feet; the mountain tilted up
at a new angle; there was the rumble of
tons of snow sliding over the steeps, and
away it went in a huge white avalanche,
bearing me, who had started it, upon
its crest, sick with sudden fear.</p>

<p>The itch of life was in my fingers; it,
and no thought of mine, made me reach
out and grasp at the sturdy shrubs which
grew on the mountain-side. With each
hand full, I hung on, and shouted and
kicked. Big waves of snow tumbled
over me and loosened my arms in their
sockets, but I swung to my brave
bushes until I had received my last douse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of snow and the slope was swept
clean.</p>

<p>I managed to get my toes into a cleft,
and my arms felt better. My head was
beginning to think and come to the relief
of instinct. I saw that I was about
ten feet from the crest of the cliff; which
was not far, but too far. I tried to draw
myself up by the bushes, but I was no
sailor, and I failed. Then I shouted
with all my might. I had seen the
smoke of the camp just before my fall,
and I hoped my voice would reach the
men there. I never knew before that I
had such a good voice.</p>

<p>"Hello-o-o-o!" I shouted.</p>

<p>The mountains took up the cry and
sent it back to me.</p>

<p>"What's the matter down there?"
called out some one.</p>

<p>"The matter?" I said, angrily.
"There's no matter at all; I came down
here merely for amusement. I do this
sort of thing often."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked up and saw the red face of
Colonel Hetherill peeping over the brink
at me.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's young West, the Yankee
spy," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm young West, I'll admit, but I'm
no Yankee spy," I replied.</p>

<p>"I insist that you are a Yankee spy,"
he said, in an infernally calm and convincing
manner. "What proof can you
give that you are not?"</p>

<p>"Colonel," I cried, and I'm sure that
my tone was convincing, "for heaven's
sake drop that Yankee spy business and
get me out of this."</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, very stiffly, "I have
accused you of being a Yankee spy, and
I will compel you to admit that you are
a Yankee spy."</p>

<p>"Colonel," I shouted, "my arms are
growing tired, and so are my toes, and
it is at least two hundred feet to the
bottom."</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, still very stiff and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
haughty, "I despise falsehoods, and so
do all Southern gentlemen. You are a
Yankee spy, and you still have the face
to deny it."</p>

<p>"Pull me up colonel," I cried. "I'm
getting awful tired."</p>

<p>"Are you not a Yankee spy?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I thought I felt some of the muscles
in my arms cracking. The time to despise
trifles had arrived.</p>

<p>"Yes, colonel," I said, "I'll admit
that I'm a Yankee spy or anything else
you want to charge against me."</p>

<p>"Good enough," he said. "Now
when I let my coat down, grip it with
your right hand, and hold on as if you
had grown to it."</p>

<p>He pulled off his Confederate overcoat,
curved his left arm around a jutting
rock, and with his right hand lowered
the coat to me. I embedded my right
hand in the gray garment, and, grasping
with the other at the short shrubs, tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
scramble up. I did get about half-way,
but as I could find no more crevices for
my toes, I hung there, limp and exhausted.</p>

<p>"I can't do it, colonel," I gasped.</p>

<p>"You must," he said.</p>

<p>He tried to draw me up, but I was too
heavy a weight for a single arm. He
was half over the gulf himself, but his
left arm was wound like a cable around
the rock. His face was red as a beet
and his breath was short, but he showed
no inclination to let go.</p>

<p>"You can't do it, colonel," I gasped.
"Save yourself! No need for both of us
to drop."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man do you take me
to be?" he asked, indignantly.</p>

<p>He breathed hard and made a great
effort to pull me up. A flake of blood
appeared on his temple. I was raised up
about a foot and got a new grip on some
of the shrubs, but there I stopped. I
could not lift myself up any farther,
nor could the colonel lift me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>I could hear men plunging through
the snow in their haste; so my shouts
had been heard by more than the colonel.
I put my voice to its best uses
again. The colonel said nothing, but
how he hung on to that old army overcoat!
The men had begun to shout,
and I never ceased, wanting them to
make sure of the direction. Weather-seamed
faces looked over the brink.
Two or three pairs of hands grasped the
overcoat and pulled me up. Somebody
else seized the colonel, and I have but a
hazy idea of the next five minutes. A
man who has been hanging at the verge
of death gets tired in both brain and
muscle, and I needed rest.</p>

<p>When things came around all right
again, I was sitting up on the snow and
drinking out of a brown bottle. The
colonel was lying on that blessed overcoat,
his head in his daughter's lap and
his face quite pale. They were binding
a white cloth around his temples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked, weakly.</p>

<p>"An old wound on his head has
broken," replied one of the men, in a
low voice. "I'm afraid he's in a pretty
bad way."</p>

<p>I put down the brown bottle which
had comforted me, and I saw that the
colonel in fact was in a bad way. He
was unconscious, and his breathing was
weak. He seemed to have collapsed
after a season of fever and excitement
followed by the great physical strain put
upon him by the attempted rescue of me.</p>

<p>I was struck with remorse. My arrival
at Fort Defiance had caused all this
trouble. Yet my going there was an
accident, not a matter that I could have
helped.</p>

<p>I sent one of the men after Dr. Ambrose,
pointing out the direction in which
he had gone, and urging the man to
make all haste. Then we lifted the colonel
and carried him to the hut, where
with overcoats and blankets we fixed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
a warm bed for him and did what else we
could until the doctor came, which was
not till late.</p>

<p>"He has about an even chance, Miss
Hetherill," said the doctor, after he had
made his examination. "The odds
might be his if I had here all that I
need, but this is no hospital. I think it
is best to tell you the exact truth."</p>

<p>I thought so too. There are women
and women; some are brave and some
are not; I like the brave ones best. She
became chief nurse at once. Lucky it is
for a man, ill in such a place, to have a
woman's care. I, still feeling remorse,
although my reason told me I was not at
fault, helped all I could.</p>

<p>The snow ceased, and toward evening
the colonel grew stronger. Dr. Ambrose
had managed to close up the reopened
wound and stop the bleeding, but a burning
fever came over him and he began to
talk very wildly. Then I saw how the
things on which a man's mind is centred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
when he wakes come out again in sleep
or delirium. His talk was all of the
war and the old battles, which he was
fighting as if he rode and charged in
them again.</p>

<p>I, who loved the Union, could not
help feeling a deep sympathy for him, he
seemed to have taken the matter so much
to heart. When he rambled on to the
end of the war,&mdash;that is, the end according
to history,&mdash;and repeated again and
again his declaration to stand out forever,
I was touched, and touched very
deeply. Some one brought him the
news that Lee was dead.</p>

<p>"I will not believe it," he cried, in his
delirium. "It's a lie. He is living, and
he will lead us again."</p>

<p>He rose suddenly, and, fixing his fever-filled
eyes upon me, demanded of me to
bear witness that it was a lie.</p>

<p>"Yes, colonel," I said, as soothingly
as I could, "it's a lie: the general is
living, and he is your commander still."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>I think I will get forgiveness for my
own lie.</p>

<p>After a while he sank into something
which resembled sleep more and delirium
less, and was quiet. Miss Hetherill
stepped to the little door for air. Only
she and I were there.</p>

<p>"Miss Hetherill," I said, reproaching
myself, "how you must blame me for
bringing all this grief upon you and
yours!"</p>

<p>"You could not help it," she said,
very gently, "and perhaps, as I told you
before, it may be for the best, after all.
A rough cure may be the best cure."</p>

<p>Dr. Ambrose came up then and insisted
that we should take rest while
others watched. We fenced off a corner
of the camp for Grace. I sought my
own place, and was soon sound asleep.
In the morning I found the colonel in
delirium again, though not so violent as
he had been in the early part of the
night. He was talking about me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
seemed to weigh upon his conscience, as
he had weighed upon mine. He had
never meant to do it, he said. He
would not have executed me, though he
still seemed to think that his military
duty commanded it. At any rate, he
was apologizing to me in his sleep, when
a man's talk speaks his thoughts and no
falsehoods or evasions.</p>

<p>"How could I execute him?" he said.
"And we slept under the same blanket,
too."</p>

<p>The second attack of delirium did not
last long, and Dr. Ambrose then said
that the patient's progress was good: if
we could only get him back to Fort
Defiance he would guarantee his recovery.</p>

<p>The snow had ceased and the clouds
had gone, leaving a cheerful sun shining
on a white wilderness. We decided to
undertake the journey to Fort Defiance,
and our preparations were brief. We
had sufficient skill and material to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a rude litter for the colonel, and we lifted
him gently into it. Then we gathered
up our baggage and set out, four men
carrying the litter and relieved at brief
intervals by the other sets.</p>

<p>We had to trample a way through the
deep snow, and there was plenty of hard
work for us, but we became a cheerful
little army. The colonel was asleep in
his litter and seemed to be growing
steadily better; the doctor reported that
his pulse was stronger and his fever was
departing. Grace passed from sadness
into cheerfulness, almost gayety. I called
her our vivandiere: she replied she was
proud of the place.</p>

<p>"You heard what my father said about
you in his delirium?" she said, when we
became the last two of the procession.
"He would not have executed you."</p>

<p>"Colonel Hetherill is a fine man, and
he has my gratitude," I replied, not
liking to see her under the necessity of
excusing him. "He saved my life a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
second time. If it hadn't been for him,
I'd now be a very cold corpse at the
bottom of a two-hundred-foot precipice,
under about fifteen feet of snow."</p>

<p>"That would have been a chilly
tomb," she said, gayly; "but it was not
for you, and we are all thankful."</p>

<p>The weather, it seemed, wished to
make some amends for its previous
wickedness. The sun was bright and
the air fresh and full of tonic. Only
the snow stood in our way. But we
made good progress in spite of it. At
night we devised another rude camp, and
took plenty of sleep. The colonel continued
to improve, and his head became
quite clear again. He talked a little, but
in a weak tone, and the doctor ordered
him to be silent for his own good. He
obeyed like a little child. In fact, his
change in manner and appearance was
very striking. He was no longer the
haughty, high-tempered colonel. He
was crushed and forlorn. All the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
seemed to have gone out of him. It
was most pitiful. I felt sorrier than
ever for him, for I knew he looked upon
himself as a defeated man.</p>

<p>We caught the first glimpse of Fort
Defiance that afternoon. I saw the
comb of its roof shining like a great
white sword-blade in the sun. The valley,
like the mountains, was in garments
of white, but the sight of the houses
and fields, under snow though they were,
warmed the heart after the weary tramp
among the clefts and peaks.</p>

<p>We descended the slopes and entered
the valley. It was my turn to be one
of the four at the colonel's litter. As
we swung along at a good pace, I noticed
suddenly that the old man had put
his hands to his face and a tear was
dropping between two fingers.</p>

<p>I was silent for a while from respect,
but, as he did not take his hands away,
I asked at last, though as quietly as I
could,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the matter, colonel? Do
you feel worse?"</p>

<p>He took his hands away, and his face
was like that of a dead man.</p>

<p>"Not worse in body, Mr. West," he
replied, "but worse, much worse, in
mind. I have failed in everything, and
through the treachery of my own people.
You have corrupted them all. Even
my own daughter has turned against me.
I am going to Fort Defiance, which was
our last stronghold, a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Colonel," said I, "what are you
thinking about? What are you dreaming
of? You a prisoner! Fort Defiance
betrayed! Look yonder!"</p>

<p>We were near the fort now, and I
pointed to the Confederate flag, that
waved over it, folding and unfolding in
the clear frosty breeze. The colonel
looked, and his face changed in a moment
from death to life. The blood
flowed into his cheeks; his eyes sparkled
like a soldier's eager for battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what does that mean?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Mean?" I said. "It means that
you've been dreaming, or you wouldn't
talk about being betrayed, a prisoner.
What made you rush off in such haste?
Dr. Ambrose's suggestion of surrender
was a sudden thought, of which he has
repented. Fort Defiance is as loyal to
you as ever. You are its absolute commander.
I am the prisoner, not you."</p>

<p>Dr. Ambrose had been walking by
the litter. The colonel beckoned to
him.</p>

<p>"Is this so, Dr. Ambrose?" he asked.
"Is what Mr. West tells me true? Am
I still master of my own?"</p>

<p>"Certainly: how could it be otherwise,"
replied the doctor, with great emphasis.
"What are your orders, colonel?"</p>

<p>"Tell one of the men," he said, in a
voice very firm despite his physical
weakness, "to go on ahead to the fort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and direct those who are there to salute
us as we approach. Mr. West, you are
my prisoner, but there are certain circumstances
in your favor which I will
consider. You shall have the liberty of
the fort and valley, if you pledge your
word not to attempt to escape for the
present."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, colonel," I said;
"and I thank you for your kindness."</p>

<p>"Grace," he said to his daughter, "remember
that while Mr. West is our
prisoner he is to be treated as our guest.
See to it, for I am afraid this unfortunate
illness will interfere somewhat with my
duties as host."</p>

<p>"I will do my best," she said.</p>

<p>We proceeded at a deliberate pace
across the plain. As we came close to
the fort, the little brass cannon boomed
again and again. The drawbridge was
down, and the men whom we left at the
fort were drawn up at parade in their
best uniforms on either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
bridge-head. They saluted as the colonel
rode proudly and triumphantly between
their lines in his litter.</p>

<p>He looked up at the flag which he
loved so well, took off his hat, his face
flushing with pride, and thus we carried
him into the fort.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />I AM IN FAVOR.</h2></div>


<p>We sat again in the great drawing-room
at Fort Defiance. The
military appearance of the apartment was
unchanged. The portraits of the Confederate
generals looked from wall to
wall at each other. The bright sun, reflected
from the snow outside, gleamed
on the burnished arms. At the head of
the table sat the colonel, in his most
brilliant uniform, stiff and precise as a
judge should be. Dr. Ambrose at the
side of the table took their statements
in writing, and six men in Confederate
gray, Crothers at their head, listened attentively
to the evidence.</p>

<p>Thus my second trial on the charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of being a Yankee spy, appealed on a
writ of error from the first, drew to its
end.</p>

<p>Miss Hetherill sat beside the window.
Streaks of dim gold showed in her dark
hair where the winter sunshine fell across
it. When her eyes met mine a bit of a
smile appeared in them, and the delicate
color in her cheeks deepened.</p>

<p>The last evidence was given, and the
colonel directed the military jury to retire
to the next room and consider a
verdict. When they had gone we
waited in silence. The snow-birds
hopped about outside. One of them
perched on the window-sill and stared
at us through the glass for a moment.
Then he flew away. The snow on the
knife-edge of the distant mountain ridges
shone like gold under the sun.</p>

<p>The jury returned, Crothers at their
head.</p>

<p>"What is your verdict, gentlemen?"
asked the colonel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not guilty," replied Crothers. "It
is our unanimous decision."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," said the colonel.
"It is my opinion too. Mr. West, my
congratulations and sympathy as from
one honest enemy to another."</p>

<p>He reached over and gave my hand a
strong and friendly grasp.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, "that until we
return you to your own country you are
our guest in the fullest sense of the
word."</p>

<p>Dr. Ambrose and Crothers also shook
my hand, and everybody seemed to be
glad that we had arrived at the truth at last.</p>

<p>By and by, only Grace and I were left
in the room. We stood by the great
window; the brilliant sunlight reflected
from the snow threw a broad band of
gold across the floor. Her face, for the
first time since I knew her, seemed peaceful
and content.</p>

<p>The snow-birds hopped from one little
white mound to another, like their breth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ren
of the summer passing from flower
to flower. Three or four flew to the
brave little brass cannon which menaced
the passage of the drawbridge, and
perched upon its barrel.</p>

<p>"They don't seem to fear the dogs of
war," I said.</p>

<p>"They need not," said Grace. "Our
cannon will never be used again; the last
salute cracked the barrel all the way."</p>

<p>"Do you forgive me," I asked, asking
the old question, "for bringing so much
trouble upon Fort Defiance?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive," she
said, earnestly. "It was no fault of
yours."</p>

<p>I became brave.</p>

<p>"Then you are not sorry I came?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>I took her hands in mine.</p>

<p>"You are sorry I am going?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I kissed her for the second time in my
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>The day had come for me to leave
Fort Defiance. The great snow had
gone. The whole Confederate army,
its commander at its head, accompanied
me as a guard of honor to the end of
the valley. Crothers would guide me
across the mountains. When the time
came for the others to turn back, Colonel
Hetherill shook my hand again.</p>

<p>"You are a gallant and honest enemy,"
he said, paying me the highest compliment
he knew.</p>

<p>Grace walked a little farther. Then I
took both her hands in mine and kissed
her for the third but not the last time in
my life.</p>

<p>The trumpet sounded the recall from
the walls of Fort Defiance.</p>

<p>"I will come again," I said.</p>

<p>"But not as an enemy."</p>

<p>"Never as an enemy."</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
